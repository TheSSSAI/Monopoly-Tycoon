## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-018

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system shall integrate the Serilog framework to handle all application logging, configured to produce structured log entries.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- The Serilog library is the sole logging provider.
- Log output is in a machine-readable format like JSON.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The repository must include all necessary Serilog NuGet packages.
- A central configuration mechanism is required to set up the Serilog pipeline.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement dictates the core technology (Serilog) and purpose of this entire repository.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-022

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system must ensure that no personally identifiable information (PII) is written to any log file, with the sole exception of the user-provided profile name which is permitted for debugging context.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Review of log files confirms no PII (other than profile name) is present.
- A custom filtering or redaction mechanism is implemented in the logging pipeline.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- Requires a custom Serilog destructuring policy or enricher.
- This policy needs to be aware of domain model types that may contain PII, creating a dependency on the Domain Models repository.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This security requirement defines a critical integration point where this infrastructure repository must inspect data from the domain model layer (REPO-DM-001) to perform redaction.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-014

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The application must render at a sustained average of 60 frames per second (FPS) and must not drop below 45 FPS during typical gameplay scenarios...

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- FPS metrics are met during gameplay.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- Logging I/O must be performed asynchronously to prevent blocking the main game thread.
- The Serilog file sink must be wrapped in an asynchronous sink.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This performance non-functional requirement dictates a critical aspect of the logging integration: all file I/O must be non-blocking. This mandates the use of an asynchronous logging pipeline.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

### 1.3.1.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.1.1 Component Name

LoggingServiceRegistration

#### 1.3.1.2 Component Specification

A set of components (DI Extension Method, Factory) that encapsulate the entire Serilog configuration and register it with the application's main DI container. This is the public API of the library.

#### 1.3.1.3 Implementation Requirements

- Must provide a single extension method on IServiceCollection for easy setup.
- Must use the IOptions pattern to read configuration from an external source.
- Must correctly configure the asynchronous file sink, JSON formatter, and PII redaction policy.

#### 1.3.1.4 Architectural Context

Infrastructure Layer. Acts as the Composition Root for all logging services.

#### 1.3.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This component represents the primary integration point for the entire application, providing a clean and configurable way to enable logging.

### 1.3.2.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.2.1 Component Name

PiiRedactionPolicy

#### 1.3.2.2 Component Specification

A custom Serilog IDestructuringPolicy that inspects objects being logged. If an object is a known domain type containing PII (e.g., a PlayerProfile from REPO-DM-001), it redacts sensitive properties before serialization.

#### 1.3.2.3 Implementation Requirements

- Must be able to identify specific properties on specific types for redaction.
- Must be performant to avoid slowing down the logging pipeline.

#### 1.3.2.4 Architectural Context

Infrastructure Layer. A critical security component that integrates with the Serilog pipeline.

#### 1.3.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This component is the concrete implementation of REQ-1-022 and creates a necessary dependency on the domain models for its operation.

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Infrastructure Layer', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Provides cross-cutting technical capabilities, such as logging, to all other layers of the application.', 'layer_constraints': ['Must not contain business logic.', 'Must depend on abstractions, not concrete application or domain classes.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Dependency Injection', 'Factory Pattern', 'Options Pattern'], 'extraction_reasoning': 'This repository is explicitly defined as a cross-cutting library within the Infrastructure Layer, responsible for the technical concern of logging.'}

## 1.5.0.0 Dependency Interfaces

### 1.5.1.0 Interface Name

#### 1.5.1.1 Interface Name

ILogger

#### 1.5.1.2 Source Repository

REPO-AA-004

#### 1.5.1.3 Method Contracts

*No items available*

#### 1.5.1.4 Integration Pattern

Interface Implementation

#### 1.5.1.5 Communication Protocol

In-process, Compile-time

#### 1.5.1.6 Extraction Reasoning

This repository provides the concrete implementation for the application-wide logging abstraction defined in the Application Abstractions layer (REPO-AA-004), adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.

### 1.5.2.0 Interface Name

#### 1.5.2.1 Interface Name

Domain Models (e.g., PlayerProfile)

#### 1.5.2.2 Source Repository

REPO-DM-001

#### 1.5.2.3 Method Contracts

*No items available*

#### 1.5.2.4 Integration Pattern

Type Consumption

#### 1.5.2.5 Communication Protocol

In-process, Compile-time

#### 1.5.2.6 Extraction Reasoning

This repository has a critical but indirect dependency on the domain models from REPO-DM-001. The PiiRedactionPolicy component must be aware of types like PlayerProfile to inspect their properties and redact sensitive data, as mandated by REQ-1-022. This is a necessary integration for security compliance.

### 1.5.3.0 Interface Name

#### 1.5.3.1 Interface Name

IConfiguration

#### 1.5.3.2 Source Repository

Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration (Framework)

#### 1.5.3.3 Method Contracts

*No items available*

#### 1.5.3.4 Integration Pattern

Service Consumption (via DI)

#### 1.5.3.5 Communication Protocol

In-process, Runtime

#### 1.5.3.6 Extraction Reasoning

To ensure the logging library is configurable without recompilation (e.g., changing log paths or retention policies), it consumes the standard .NET IConfiguration service to bind its settings via the Options Pattern.

## 1.6.0.0 Exposed Interfaces

- {'interface_name': 'DependencyInjectionExtensions.AddLoggingServices', 'consumer_repositories': ['REPO-PU-010'], 'method_contracts': [{'method_name': 'AddLoggingServices', 'method_signature': 'IServiceCollection AddLoggingServices(this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration)', 'method_purpose': "To configure and register the entire Serilog logging pipeline with the application's central dependency injection container.", 'implementation_requirements': 'This method acts as the sole public entry point for the library. It must orchestrate the binding of LoggingOptions, creation of the Serilog logger, and registration of the logger as the provider for the ILogger interface.'}], 'service_level_requirements': [], 'implementation_constraints': ['This method should be called once at application startup within the Composition Root (REPO-PU-010).'], 'extraction_reasoning': 'This DI extension method is the primary exposed contract of this repository. It provides the mechanism by which the entire application is configured to use the logging service. All other repositories consume the logger indirectly via DI, making this registration method the key integration point.'}

## 1.7.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0 Framework Requirements

.NET 8, C#

### 1.7.2.0 Integration Technologies

- Serilog
- Serilog.Sinks.File
- Serilog.Sinks.Async
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration

### 1.7.3.0 Performance Constraints

To meet application-wide performance NFRs (e.g., REQ-1-014), the logging pipeline must be fully asynchronous. This is achieved by wrapping the file sink with Serilog.Sinks.Async to offload I/O operations from the calling thread.

### 1.7.4.0 Security Requirements

The integration must include a custom PII redaction policy to prevent sensitive user data from being written to log files, fulfilling REQ-1-022. Log files must be stored in the secure user-specific %APPDATA% directory as per REQ-1-020.
