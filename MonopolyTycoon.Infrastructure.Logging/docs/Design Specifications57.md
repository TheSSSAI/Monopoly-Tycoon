# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Provide the sole, centralized, and concrete implementation of the application's logging infrastructure using the Serilog library.
- Encapsulate all logging configuration, including sinks for structured JSON files, rolling file policies, and custom logic for PII sanitization, isolating the Serilog dependency from the rest of the application.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- .NET 8
- C#
- Serilog

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must exist as a cross-cutting library within the Infrastructure Layer, providing its services to all other layers via Dependency Injection.
- Must provide a concrete implementation of the 'ILogger' interface defined in a shared abstractions library (REPO-AA-004), adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.
- Must be configurable via standard .NET configuration providers (e.g., 'appsettings.json') using the 'IOptions' pattern.

### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

This repository is a critical infrastructure component that underpins the application's observability and reliability. Its primary technical challenge is the implementation of a performant and accurate PII sanitization filter (REQ-1-022). The design must prioritize asynchronous processing to prevent logging I/O from impacting application performance.

#### 3.1.1.2.0 Requirement Description

Use Serilog as the logging framework.

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The repository's .csproj file must include package references for 'Serilog', 'Serilog.Extensions.Logging', and necessary sinks/enrichers.
- A static configuration class or an 'IServiceCollection' extension method will be created to build the 'LoggerConfiguration'.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- logging-service-101

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the foundational requirement dictating the core technology choice for the entire library.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-019

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

Logging output must be structured JSON.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The 'Serilog.Sinks.File' package will be used.
- The file sink must be configured with a 'Serilog.Formatting.Json.JsonFormatter' to ensure output is structured JSON.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- logging-service-101

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement enables machine-readable logs, which is essential for automated analysis, monitoring, and debugging.

### 3.1.3.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-021

#### 3.1.3.2.0 Requirement Description

Implement rolling log files.

#### 3.1.3.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The 'Serilog.Sinks.File' configuration must specify a 'rollingInterval' (e.g., 'Day') and/or 'fileSizeLimitBytes' to manage log file growth and retention.
- The log file path must be configurable.

#### 3.1.3.4.0 Required Components

- logging-service-101

#### 3.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This prevents log files from consuming excessive disk space and simplifies log management in a production environment.

### 3.1.4.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.4.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-022

#### 3.1.4.2.0 Requirement Description

Sanitize Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from logs.

#### 3.1.4.3.0 Implementation Implications

- A custom Serilog 'IDestructuringPolicy' or 'ILogEventEnricher' must be implemented.
- This custom component will inspect log properties and apply redaction logic (e.g., using Regex) to sensitive data before it is written to the sink.

#### 3.1.4.4.0 Required Components

- logging-service-101

#### 3.1.4.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is a critical security and privacy requirement that mandates custom development, as default logging behavior would expose sensitive user data.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

Logging operations must not block application threads or negatively impact user experience (related to REQ-1-014 FPS and REQ-1-015 load times).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

The logging pipeline must be asynchronous. This requires wrapping the primary file sink with the 'Serilog.Sinks.Async' wrapper.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- File I/O must be offloaded to a background thread.
- The PII sanitization logic must be computationally efficient.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Synchronous file I/O is a common cause of performance bottlenecks. An asynchronous logging pipeline is non-negotiable for meeting the application's performance quality attributes.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Reliability

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

The logging system must reliably capture critical error information, especially for unhandled exceptions (REQ-1-023).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The logging library itself must be exceptionally robust and avoid throwing exceptions. Serilog's 'SelfLog' feature should be configured to output internal logging errors to the console or debug stream to aid diagnostics without crashing the application.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- The logger configuration must be fail-safe.
- The library must not have dependencies that can fail in a way that disrupts logging.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The logging service is a key component of the overall system's reliability and error-handling strategy. Its failure would compromise the ability to diagnose any other system failure.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The requirements for this repository are well-defined and synergistic, focusing on creating a robust, performant, and secure logging foundation. The implementation will center on the correct configuration of the Serilog pipeline, with custom development required for PII sanitization. Meeting performance NFRs mandates an asynchronous sink configuration.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by systematically processing all provided context. Requirements REQ-1-018 through REQ-1-022 directly defined the repository's features. The Architecture document established its place in the Infrastructure Layer and its dependency-inverted relationship with abstractions. Sequence diagrams (192, 178, 185) provided concrete examples of how the 'ILogger' interface is consumed, confirming its role and interaction patterns.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Identified the repository as a cross-cutting concern in the Infrastructure Layer.
- Mapped specific requirements to Serilog features (Sinks, Formatters, Enrichers).
- Concluded that DI and 'IServiceCollection' extensions are the correct .NET 8 integration pattern.
- Determined from performance NFRs that an asynchronous logging sink is a mandatory implementation detail.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Validated that 'ILogger' in the architecture map refers to the standard 'Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger' interface, as this is the idiomatic choice for .NET 8.
- Validated that the repository provides a service consumed by other components, rather than consuming services itself.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Cross-referenced REQ-1-018 (Serilog) with the repository's specified technology stack, confirming consistency.
- Cross-referenced the repository's description of implementing 'ILogger' with the 'architecture_map' which explicitly states it implements an interface from REPO-AA-004.
- Cross-referenced the global exception handling sequence (ID 192) with the logging requirements, confirming the logger's critical role in system reliability.
