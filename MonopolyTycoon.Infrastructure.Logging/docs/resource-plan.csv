TASK-005-01,"Backend: Implement Global Exception Handler Service",Backend Development,DevOps,High,8.3,Senior,1,"",Yes,"Requires a senior backend developer with deep knowledge of .NET application lifecycle and exception handling patterns.","Use a third-party crash reporting SDK, but this would violate the 'no network connectivity' constraint and add external dependencies."
TASK-005-02,"Integration: Connect Exception Handler to Logging Service",Backend Development,DevOps,Medium,6.3,Mid,1,"TASK-005-01",Yes,"Developer should be familiar with the Serilog framework and structured logging principles to ensure auditability requirements are met.","Log to a simple text file instead of structured JSON, but this sacrifices the queryable, machine-readable audit trail required by REQ-1-028."
TASK-005-03,"Frontend: Create Fatal Error Dialog UI",Frontend Development,Design,High,10.3,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Requires a Unity UI developer to create a self-contained, robust scene that can be loaded in a fail state with minimal dependencies.","Use a native OS message box (e.g., via P/Invoke) instead of a Unity UI. This is simpler but breaks visual consistency with the game's theme."
TASK-005-04,"Integration: Display Error Dialog from Exception Handler",Backend Development,Frontend Development,High,8.5,Senior,1,"TASK-005-01,TASK-005-03",Yes,"Requires a developer experienced with Unity's threading model to handle UI updates from a non-main (exception handling) thread.","Instead of pushing the event, have the main thread poll for an error state. This avoids cross-thread complexity but introduces latency in displaying the error."
TASK-005-05,Review and Documentation,Product Management,Backend Development,Medium,4.2,Senior,2,"TASK-005-01,TASK-005-02,TASK-005-03,TASK-005-04",No,"Requires a technical writer for documentation and a lead developer for the final code review of the entire error handling pipeline.","Auto-generate documentation from code comments. This is faster but may lack the high-level architectural context needed for such a critical system."
TASK-049-01,"Frontend: Create Player HUD Panel Prefab",Frontend Development,Design,Medium,6.0,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Requires a Unity developer proficient with TextMeshPro and creating reusable, data-driven UI prefabs that can be easily instantiated.","Create a single monolithic HUD instead of reusable panels. This is faster initially but less scalable for different player counts and harder to maintain."
TASK-049-02,"Backend: Implement HUDController for Data Binding",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Critical,12.0,Senior,1,"TASK-049-01",Yes,"Requires a developer with strong C# skills and experience in event-driven architecture to decouple the UI from game logic effectively.","Use direct polling in an Update() loop instead of an event-driven model. This is highly inefficient, creates tight coupling, and is considered poor practice."
TASK-049-03,"Testing: Create Integration Test for HUD Updates",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,High,10.3,Mid,1,"TASK-049-02",Yes,"Requires a QA Automation Engineer familiar with the Unity Test Framework and mocking game states/events to verify UI logic without full gameplay.","Rely solely on manual testing for the HUD. This is inefficient, time-consuming, and highly prone to missing regressions in future updates."
TASK-049-04,Review and Documentation,Product Management,Backend Development,Medium,4.2,Senior,2,"TASK-049-01,TASK-049-02",No,"Requires a technical writer and a lead developer for the code review to ensure the event-driven architecture is well-documented.","Rely on code comments only. This misses the architectural overview of how the HUD interacts with the game's event bus, increasing onboarding time for new developers."
TASK-061-01,"Backend: Develop SaveGameRepository for Serialization",Backend Development,Data Engineering,Critical,12.3,Senior,1,"",Yes,"Requires a senior developer experienced with data serialization (System.Text.Json), async file I/O, and data integrity verification (SHA256 checksums).","Use binary serialization instead of JSON. This results in smaller files but sacrifices human-readability, making debugging and migration significantly harder."
TASK-061-02,"Frontend: Implement Save Game UI Screen",Frontend Development,Design,High,10.3,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Unity UI developer needed. Task involves not just layout but also file I/O for reading save metadata to populate the slots, requiring backend-adjacent skills.","Use a simple list of filenames instead of rich slots with metadata. This is a much poorer user experience and makes it hard to identify saves."
TASK-061-03,"Integration: Connect Save UI to Save Repository",Backend Development,Frontend Development,High,8.3,Mid,1,"TASK-061-01,TASK-061-02",Yes,"Requires a developer who understands both the Unity UI event system and the backend repository's async API to connect them without blocking the main thread.","Tightly couple the UI directly to the file system logic in the button's click handler. This violates separation of concerns and makes the code untestable."
TASK-061-04,"Testing: Create Unit Tests for Save Logic",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Medium,7.2,Mid,1,"TASK-061-01",Yes,"QA Automation Engineer with C# and NUnit/Moq experience. Must be able to mock file system interactions to test serialization and checksum logic in isolation.","Rely on end-to-end manual save/load tests. This is not a substitute as it cannot easily isolate and verify specific failures in the serialization or checksum logic."
TASK-032-01,"Backend: Develop Auction Manager Service",Backend Development,N/A,Critical,12.3,Senior,1,"",Yes,"Requires a strong C# developer experienced with designing and implementing state machines to handle the complex, multi-player, turn-based flow of an auction.","Implement the logic as a simple loop within a single method. This would be extremely brittle, hard to debug, and difficult to integrate with asynchronous player (human/AI) actions."
TASK-032-02,"Frontend: Implement Auction UI Prefab",Frontend Development,Design,High,10.3,Mid,1,"",Yes,"Unity UI developer to create a dynamic modal dialog that can update in real-time based on bids from multiple sources simultaneously.","Use a series of static pop-ups for each bid event. This would create a very slow, clunky, and confusing user experience."
TASK-032-03,"Integration: Connect Auction UI to Manager",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Critical,12.0,Senior,1,"TASK-032-01,TASK-032-02",Yes,"Requires a developer experienced in event-driven UI to ensure the modal is responsive and correctly reflects the backend state machine's state without polling.","Tightly couple the UI and manager with direct method calls. This makes the code harder to test, maintain, and debug, especially with multiple actors (player, AIs)."
TASK-032-04,"AI: Implement AI Bidding Logic Node",Backend Development,"Data Engineering",Critical,14.3,Senior,1,"TASK-032-01",Yes,"Requires an AI specialist or a senior developer with experience in game AI, specifically behavior trees and utility-based decision making for economic actions.","Implement very simple logic (e.g., bid randomly up to 50% of cash). This would fail to provide the tunable, variable challenge required by REQ-1-004 and REQ-1-064."
TASK-032-05,"Testing: Create Unit Tests for AuctionManager",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,High,8.3,Mid,1,"TASK-032-01",Yes,"QA Automation Engineer to write tests covering the complex state transitions of the auction state machine, including withdrawals and winner declaration logic.","Rely on integration tests alone. This makes it much harder to isolate and test specific edge cases in the state machine logic without setting up a full game state."
TASK-032-06,"Testing: Create Integration Test for Full Auction Flow",Quality Assurance,Backend Development,Critical,12.3,Senior,1,"TASK-032-03,TASK-032-04",Yes,"Senior QA Automation Engineer to script a complex test scenario involving UI, game logic, and AI interactions within the Unity Test Framework.","Manual end-to-end testing only. This is slow, cannot be easily repeated in a CI pipeline, and significantly increases the risk of regressions."
TASK-032-07,"Review and Documentation",Product Management,Backend Development,Medium,4.2,Lead,2,"TASK-032-01,TASK-032-02,TASK-032-03,TASK-032-04",No,"Requires a technical writer, an AI developer to explain the config parameters, and a lead engineer for the comprehensive code review of the entire feature.","Skip formal documentation and rely on the code. This increases the 'bus factor' and makes future maintenance, balancing, and onboarding of new developers much harder."
