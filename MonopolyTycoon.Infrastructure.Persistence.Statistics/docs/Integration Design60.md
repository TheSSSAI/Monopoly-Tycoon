## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-032

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system shall manage a human player profile consisting of a user-provided display name and a system-generated, persistent, unique profile_id.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- A player profile can be created with a unique name.
- An existing player profile can be retrieved by its name.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The repository must implement a GetOrCreateProfileAsync method that atomically handles SELECT and INSERT operations.
- The PlayerProfile table in the SQLite database must have a UNIQUE constraint on the displayName column to enforce uniqueness at the data layer.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement directly mandates the profile persistence functionality that this repository is responsible for implementing via the PlayerProfileRepository component, as confirmed by the database ERD and sequence diagrams.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-033

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system must track and permanently store a set of historical gameplay statistics for the human player's profile.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Upon game completion, statistics such as total games played and total wins are correctly updated in the database.
- The system can retrieve a player's all-time statistics from the database.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The repository must implement a method to transactionally update player statistics and record game results after a match.
- The SQLite schema must include tables like PlayerStatistic and GameResult as shown in the ERD.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a primary driver for this repository's existence, defining the core responsibility of persisting player statistics, which is orchestrated by the Application Services layer and executed here.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-089

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system shall store all player statistics and high scores in a local SQLite database file... Upon each successful application startup, the system must check if the database file has been modified... If it has, a backup... must be created... retaining only the three most recent copies.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- The system automatically creates a backup of the statistics database on startup.
- The system retains a fixed number of recent backups, deleting the oldest.
- The system can automatically restore from the most recent valid backup if the primary database is corrupt.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The repository must contain logic to copy the SQLite database file to a backup location.
- The repository must manage a retention policy for backups.
- The database initialization logic must include a robust try-catch block to detect corruption and trigger a recovery sequence.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This non-functional requirement for reliability defines a critical, complex feature implemented solely within this repository, involving file system operations and data integrity checks, as detailed in its scope.

### 1.2.4.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.4.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-091

#### 1.2.4.2 Requirement Text

The system shall maintain and display a 'Top Scores' list of the top 10 victories by the human player.

#### 1.2.4.3 Validation Criteria

- The system can retrieve a list of the top 10 scores, ranked by final net worth.
- The top 10 list is updated if a player's final score in a game qualifies.

#### 1.2.4.4 Implementation Implications

- The repository must implement a method to query and return the top 10 scores from the database.
- The underlying database query must be optimized with an index on the scoring column to ensure fast retrieval.

#### 1.2.4.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement mandates a specific data retrieval capability which this repository must provide to the Application Services layer for display in the UI.
