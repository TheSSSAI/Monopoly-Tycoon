A bug report rate related to core rules exceeding 5% of total reports during playtesting.,Lead Gameplay Engineer,Ongoing,Open
RISK-T-002,Technical,"The save/load system, which serializes the entire `GameState` object, is highly susceptible to breaking with any change to the data model. This could render all existing player saves invalid after a game update.",5,4,20,High,"WI-002, WI-024, WI-025, WI-026",Tight coupling between the in-memory `GameState` object and the serialized on-disk format.,"1. Implement a robust versioning and migration strategy (WI-026) from day one. 2. Write extensive integration tests for the save-load cycle using a suite of test save files (WI-027). 3. Design the `GameState` model to be as resilient to change as possible.",If a breaking change is unavoidable, communicate this clearly in patch notes. The migration service (WI-026) must be robust enough to handle the change or gracefully fail, leaving the original file intact.,Introduction of a breaking change to the `GameState` class during code review. An increase in bug reports related to 'failed to load' errors after a patch.,Lead Systems Engineer,Ongoing,Open
RISK-Q-001,Quality,"Balancing the AI's behavior across three difficulty levels to be challenging yet fair is highly subjective and can consume an unexpectedly large amount of time.

Use the cryptographically secure RNG as specified, but wrap it in a service class. 2. Profile its performance to ensure it has no noticeable impact. 3. Ensure the implementation does not block the main thread.",If performance profiling reveals an issue, switch the implementation within the service class to use a well-seeded `System.Random`, which is sufficient for this use case.,The dice rolling service is identified as a source of performance bottlenecks or CPU spikes during profiling.,Lead Gameplay Engineer,Sprint 2,Open
RISK-Q-003,Quality,"The test suite of predefined save game files (WI-027) may not cover all critical edge cases. A bug in a complex, late-game scenario (e.g., a three-way trade during a housing shortage) might be missed.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-005, WI-027, and all integration testing",The state space of Monopoly is vast, making it impossible to cover every scenario with predefined files.,"1. Empower the QA team to create new save files for the test suite whenever they discover a new, hard-to-reproduce bug. 2. Log game events extensively (WI-033) so that bugs can be reproduced from the audit trail even without a save file.",If a critical bug is found late in the cycle, dedicate QA and development time to create a specific regression test case (either a new save file or an automated test) to prevent it from recurring.,A critical bug is reported by a beta tester that cannot be reproduced with the existing suite of test save files.,QA Lead,Ongoing,Open

Wrap all file operations in robust try-catch blocks. 2. Log any failures during the backup process at the ERROR level. 3. Ensure the backup logic is one of the first things to run at startup.",If the backup system is found to be unreliable, disable it temporarily with a patch and prioritize a fix. The core risk of data corruption is low, so a failed backup is not a critical failure.,Error logs show repeated failures in the `DatabaseBackupService`. Users report losing statistics despite the system being in place.,Lead Systems Engineer,Sprint 4,Open

Create and use simple placeholder assets (e.g., cubes, capsules) for all 3D models early in development to unblock gameplay programming. 2. Establish a clear asset delivery schedule with the art team. 3. Define the technical specifications for assets (poly count, texture size) upfront.",If final assets are delayed, plan to launch with a simpler but consistent 'low-poly' aesthetic using upgraded placeholder assets. This allows the game to ship while final art is completed for a future patch.,Key 3D assets are not delivered by their scheduled sprint deadline, blocking integration.,Art Lead,Ongoing,Open
RISK-Q-004,Quality,"The requirement to not log Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (REQ-1-022) could be violated accidentally by a developer logging a complex object that contains the user's profile name in a nested property.",3,2,6,Low,"WI-032, WI-033","Developers may log entire objects for debugging convenience without considering all nested data fields.","1. Create a coding standard and review checklist item to specifically check for PII in log messages. 2. Sanitize any data that is passed to the global exception handler before it is logged. 3. Where possible, log specific properties instead of entire objects.",If a PII leak is discovered in the logs, release an immediate hotfix patch that corrects the offending log message. Issue a statement about the error if necessary.,A QA review of the log files reveals information other than the explicitly permitted 'user-provided profile name'.,Lead Systems Engineer,Ongoing,Open
