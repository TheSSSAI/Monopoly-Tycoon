## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Repository Pattern

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The repository mediates between the application/domain layers and the SQLite data source. It exposes collection-like interfaces ('IStatisticsRepository', 'IPlayerProfileRepository') for accessing player data, completely abstracting the underlying persistence mechanism (raw SQL queries over a local file).

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- StatisticsRepository
- PlayerProfileRepository

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Create concrete C# classes that implement the repository interfaces. These classes will inject a SQLite connection factory and the ILogger interface. Each public method will encapsulate a specific database operation (e.g., query, transaction script).

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is explicitly required by the architecture to decouple business logic from data access, which enhances testability and maintainability. It allows the SQLite implementation to be swapped out with minimal impact.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Layered Architecture

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

Implementation Complexity

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

The absence of an ORM like Entity Framework Core significantly increases implementation complexity and risk. The team will be responsible for manually writing SQL, mapping data to objects, managing transactions, and implementing a schema migration system from scratch.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

Higher development effort, increased risk of bugs (e.g., SQL injection if not carefully parameterized, incorrect data mapping), and a more fragile schema update process compared to industry-standard tools.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

While the technology stack is fixed, this highlights a major risk area. The manual implementation of backup/recovery ('REQ-1-089') and schema migrations adds substantial complexity that is normally handled by mature frameworks, requiring specialized attention during development and testing.

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Data Integrity

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

The logic for database backup and atomic restoration ('SEQ-176') is critical for reliability but is prone to race conditions and partial failures if not implemented carefully.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

A flawed implementation could lead to data loss, for example, if the application is closed during a file copy operation. The file replacement logic must be truly atomic (e.g., using 'File.Move' or a temporary file strategy).

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This finding elevates 'REQ-1-089' from a simple feature to a high-risk implementation detail. The success of this feature directly impacts user trust and application reliability.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by systematically processing all provided cache documents. The Repository's description provided the core scope and technology. The Architecture document defined its placement and patterns (Layered, Repository). The Database ERD provided the exact schema for entity mapping. The Requirements list defined the specific features to be implemented. The Sequence diagrams provided detailed, method-level specifications for key interactions.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Identified the repository's scope as SQLite persistence for player data.
- Mapped REQ-1-033, REQ-1-089, REQ-1-091 to specific repository responsibilities.
- Used the 'Monopoly Tycoon Player Data ERD' as the ground truth for database table and entity design.
- Translated sequences SEQ-175, SEQ-176, SEQ-189 into concrete method signatures for the repository interfaces.
- Concluded that the lack of an ORM is a critical complexity factor.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumed 'IPlayerProfileRepository' is part of this component's responsibility based on the detailed description, even though the 'architecture_map' was less specific.
- Assumed that a manual schema migration mechanism is required to fulfill the spirit of 'REQ-1-090' (data migration) for the database.
- Assumed DTOs will be used for method parameters to decouple the repository from domain logic state.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Verified that the entities in the ERD ('PlayerProfile', 'PlayerStatistic') match the data persistence requirements ('REQ-1-032', 'REQ-1-033').
- Confirmed that the repository's role in the Layered Architecture matches the responsibilities outlined for the Infrastructure Layer.
- Ensured that method signatures derived from sequence diagrams are consistent with the operations needed to fulfill the functional requirements.
