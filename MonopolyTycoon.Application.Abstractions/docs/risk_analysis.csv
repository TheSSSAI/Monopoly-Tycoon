RISK-TECH-001,Technical,"The central GameState object (WI-005) is a highly complex aggregate. Flaws in its design or serialization logic (WI-026, WI-027) could lead to widespread, critical bugs in saving, loading, and core game logic.",3,5,15,High,"WI-005, WI-026, WI-027, WI-031","High architectural complexity and a single point of failure for all game data persistence.",""Design and review the GameState schema with a focus on serialization integrity before implementation.

Simplify the object graph if serialization issues persist.","Unit tests for GameState serialization fail. Manual save/load tests reveal data inconsistencies.",Lead Developer,2025-03-15,Identified
RISK-QUAL-001,Quality,"Balancing the AI difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) to be distinct, fair, and challenging is highly subjective and complex. Poor balancing will result in a frustrating or unengaging player experience.",4,4,16,High,"WI-024, WI-025, WS-011","The complexity of AI decision-making (REQ-1-019) and the subjective nature of what constitutes 'fun' or 'fair' difficulty.",""Implement AI behavior parameters in an external JSON file (WI-023) for rapid iteration without recompiling.

AI parameter tuning takes more than 20% of the AI development time.,AI Developer,2025-05-30,Identified
RISK-TECH-002,Technical,"The save game versioning and data migration system (REQ-1-090, WI-027) is technically challenging. A failure in this system could cause players to lose all their progress after a game update, leading to severe user dissatisfaction.",3,5,15,High,"WI-027, WI-029","Forward compatibility for data schemas is inherently complex. A bug in migration logic is a destructive operation on user data.",""Develop a robust versioning strategy early. Create a dedicated test suite that attempts to migrate various 'old' versions of save files and database schemas to the current version. Ensure all migration operations are atomic and create backups before proceeding."",""If migration is too complex for a specific update, disable loading of old save files and clearly communicate this to users in the release notes, providing a valid reason. Offer a 'beta' branch for users who wish to test the migration."","Integration tests for data migration fail. The number of supported legacy save versions becomes difficult to manage.",Lead Developer,2025-06-15,Identified

The critical path is long and dense with high-risk tasks.",""Break down high-complexity work items (e.g., WI-010, WI-011, WI-025) into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. Prioritize implementing the 'happy path' for all core rules first, followed by edge cases in separate tasks. Use time-boxed spikes for technically uncertain features."",""De-scope non-critical 'polish' features (e.g., one of the two themes from REQ-1-093, advanced AI behaviors for 'Hard' difficulty) to protect the core release date.

RISK-TECH-003,Technical,"Failure to ensure atomic transactions for all game state modifications (e.g., trades, purchases, bankruptcy) can lead to data corruption and game-breaking bugs where the game state becomes inconsistent (e.g., cash deducted but property not transferred).",3,5,15,High,"WI-009, WI-010, WI-011, WI-021, WI-041","The complexity of multi-step operations on the central GameState object creates opportunities for partial failures.",""Design a centralized transaction processing service within the Rule Engine. All state-changing operations must go through this service. Use a Command pattern where each command has 'Execute' and 'Rollback' methods to ensure atomicity, wrapping the logic in try/catch blocks."",""For complex operations like bankruptcy, create a deep copy of the GameState before the operation begins. If any step fails, discard the copy and revert to the original state, logging a critical error."","An integration test (WI-031) fails, leaving the GameState in an inconsistent state. A bug is reported where a player's cash and property ownership are out of sync.",Lead Developer,2025-04-15,Identified
RISK-RSRC-001,Resource,"The project requires a specialized skill set across Unity 3D, C#, .NET architecture, and AI (Behavior Trees).

Submit key visual assets (e.g., board design, token models, UI theme concepts) for approval as early as possible, before full implementation begins. Maintain a log of all approvals."","If a key asset is rejected late in the cycle, use a generic, non-infringing placeholder asset to avoid blocking development. Negotiate with Hasbro to allow the change in a post-launch patch to protect the release schedule.",Feedback from Hasbro on submitted assets is delayed by more than two weeks.

A mismatch in .NET versions or dependencies between layers can cause runtime errors that are hard to trace.",3,3,9,Medium,"WI-001, WI-033, WI-034","Multi-project solution architecture adds an integration layer that can be a source of configuration and runtime issues.",""Maintain a single, version-controlled solution file (.sln) that includes both the Unity project's generated csproj and the external libraries. Use a CI/CD pipeline (WI-034) to automate the build process, ensuring a consistent build environment and immediate detection of integration errors."",""If debugging becomes too difficult, temporarily merge the core logic source code directly into the Unity project's Assets folder to simplify the debugging process. Re-separate the code once the issue is resolved."","The automated build pipeline fails due to a dependency conflict between Unity and the .NET libraries.

RISK-RSRC-002,Resource,"The completion of features requiring significant art and sound assets (e.g., the two themes in REQ-1-093, animated tokens in WI-015) is dependent on an external or separate art/sound team.
