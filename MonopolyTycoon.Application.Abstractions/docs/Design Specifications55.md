# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary Responsibility: Define C# interfaces (contracts) for services implemented in the Infrastructure layer, such as repositories and loggers (e.g., ISaveGameRepository, IStatisticsRepository, ILogger).
- Secondary Responsibility: Act as the decoupling mechanism between the Application/Domain layers and the Infrastructure layer, strictly enforcing the Dependency Inversion Principle.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- .NET 8
- .NET Class Library
- C#

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- This repository MUST NOT contain any concrete class implementations or business logic. It consists solely of interfaces, abstract classes, and potentially DTOs/enums used in interface signatures.
- Must have minimal dependencies, primarily referencing the Domain Model repository (REPO-DM-001) to use domain entities like 'GameState' in method signatures.
- Must be a lightweight, easily portable library to avoid transitive dependency issues in consuming projects.

# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-087

#### 3.1.1.2.0 Requirement Description

Serialize the GameState object to JSON for saving and deserialize for loading.

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires an 'ISaveGameRepository' interface.
- The interface must define methods like 'Task SaveAsync(GameState state, int slotNumber)' and 'Task<GameState> LoadAsync(int slotNumber)'.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- ISaveGameRepository

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement directly mandates a contract for game state persistence, which is the core responsibility of the save game repository abstraction.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-089

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

Manage the SQLite database for storing and retrieving player profiles and statistics.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires an 'IStatisticsRepository' and/or 'IPlayerProfileRepository' interface.
- Interfaces must define methods for creating/retrieving profiles ('GetOrCreateProfileAsync') and updating aggregate statistics ('UpdatePlayerStatisticsAsync'), as validated by sequence diagrams 189 and 190.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- IStatisticsRepository
- IPlayerProfileRepository

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement necessitates contracts for all interactions with the player's persistent data, abstracting the SQLite implementation details.

### 3.1.3.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-018

#### 3.1.3.2.0 Requirement Description

All significant application events must be logged to a local file.

#### 3.1.3.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires a generic logging interface, likely 'ILogger' or 'ILoggingService'.
- The interface should define standard logging methods like 'LogInformation', 'LogWarning', and 'LogError' to abstract the underlying logging framework (Serilog).

#### 3.1.3.4.0 Required Components

- ILogger

#### 3.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

To make logging a decoupled, cross-cutting concern, a common logging abstraction must be defined here for use throughout the application.

### 3.1.4.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.4.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-088

#### 3.1.4.2.0 Requirement Description

Implement checksum/hash validation for save files to detect corruption.

#### 3.1.4.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The 'ISaveGameRepository' interface must be designed to communicate corruption status.
- Methods like 'GetSaveGameMetadataAsync' should return DTOs that include a status field (e.g., 'Valid', 'Corrupted'), as shown in sequence diagram 194.

#### 3.1.4.4.0 Required Components

- ISaveGameRepository

#### 3.1.4.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The abstraction must provide a contract for the application layer to query the integrity of save files without knowing the specifics of checksum calculation.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Maintainability

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

Adherence to Microsoft C# Coding Conventions (REQ-1-024), Unit test coverage (REQ-1-025), Integration tests (REQ-1-026).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

The existence of this repository is a primary enabler for this NFR. It allows for dependency injection and mocking, which are prerequisites for effective unit testing of the Application Services layer.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Interfaces must be designed to be easily mockable.
- Contracts should be stable to minimize ripple effects from changes.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Decoupling via these abstractions is the core architectural tactic used to achieve high testability and maintainability.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

Load a game in under 10 seconds (REQ-1-015).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

All I/O-bound interface methods (e.g., file or database access) must be defined as asynchronous, returning 'Task' or 'Task<T>'. This prevents blocking the main thread and is essential for a responsive UI.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- All methods in 'ISaveGameRepository' and 'IStatisticsRepository' must be async.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

While this repository doesn't implement the logic, defining the contracts as async enforces a non-blocking design on the Infrastructure layer, which is critical for performance.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

This repository does not directly implement user-facing requirements. Instead, it defines the essential contracts (interfaces) that enable the decoupled implementation of functional requirements (like saving games and logging) and non-functional requirements (like maintainability and performance) in other layers of the application.

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Repository Pattern

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The interfaces 'ISaveGameRepository' and 'IStatisticsRepository' are the abstract definitions for the Repository pattern. They define a collection-like interface for accessing data sources.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- ISaveGameRepository
- IStatisticsRepository
- IPlayerProfileRepository

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Define interfaces in this project. Implement concrete classes in the MonopolyTycoon.Infrastructure project. Inject implementations into Application Services via DI.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The architecture explicitly chooses the Repository pattern to decouple business logic from data access implementation, and this repository is where the required abstractions are defined.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Dependency Inversion Principle

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

This entire repository exists to facilitate Dependency Inversion. High-level modules (Application) and low-level modules (Infrastructure) both depend on the abstractions defined here, inverting the traditional dependency flow.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- All interfaces within this library

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

This is a structural pattern. The project is created as a separate class library. Higher-level projects reference this library for interfaces, and the lower-level Infrastructure project references it to provide implementations.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The repository's description explicitly states its purpose is to facilitate this principle, which is fundamental to the system's layered architecture for achieving decoupling and testability.

Consumers will use these interfaces through dependency injection.', 'analysis_reasoning': 'The application is a monolith, so communication between layers occurs via direct, in-memory method calls. No network protocols are needed.'}

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

*No items available*

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis is based on 100% of the provided context. The repository's description, architecture map, and type were synthesized with the overarching architectural documents, database designs, and sequence diagrams to create a complete and consistent definition of its responsibilities and contracts.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Repository scope was determined from its description and type ('Cross-Cutting Library').
- Specific interface names ('ISaveGameRepository', 'IStatisticsRepository') were extracted from the description and validated against multiple sequence diagrams (187, 190, 194).
- Method signatures were derived by analyzing the data flow and parameters in sequence diagrams (e.g., 'SaveAsync' takes 'GameState' in diagram 187).
- Dependency on the Domain model (REPO-DM-001) was confirmed via the 'architecture_map'.
- The repository's role in satisfying NFRs (Maintainability, Performance) was inferred from its function as a decoupling agent in a Layered Architecture.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption that 'Application.Services' and 'Infrastructure' are separate repositories was validated by the description's explicit mention of decoupling and the Dependency Inversion Principle.
- Assumption that methods should be async was validated by the Performance NFRs and modern .NET best practices.
- Assumption of specific DTOs (e.g., 'SaveGameMetadata') was validated by sequence diagram 194, which details the UI's need for status information.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- The 'ISaveGameRepository' interface implied by REQ-1-087 was cross-referenced and confirmed in sequence diagrams 187, 188, and 194.
- The database schema for player data was cross-referenced with sequence diagram 190 to confirm the need for a transactional update method in 'IStatisticsRepository'.
