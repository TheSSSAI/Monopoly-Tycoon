# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary: Orchestrate application use cases by coordinating the Domain and Infrastructure layers in response to actions from the Presentation layer.
- Secondary: Manage the application's state lifecycle (e.g., starting, saving, loading games) and handle the flow of control for complex, multi-step processes like player turns and auctions.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- .NET 8
- C#
- .NET Class Library

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must not contain core business rule logic; this is delegated to the Domain layer (e.g., RuleEngine).
- Must not implement data persistence directly; all data access must be through repository interfaces defined in an abstractions layer.
- Must operate on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations to ensure testability and adherence to the Dependency Inversion Principle.
- All I/O-bound orchestration (e.g., loading files, database access) must be implemented asynchronously using Task-based patterns ('async/await') to maintain application responsiveness.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

Is Invoked By

##### 2.1.4.3.2 Target Component

Presentation Layer

##### 2.1.4.3.3 Integration Pattern

Direct asynchronous method calls from UI controllers/presenters to this layer's public service interfaces.

##### 2.1.4.3.4 Reasoning

The Presentation Layer delegates user actions (e.g., 'Start Game', 'Build House') to this layer for processing, acting as the entry point for all use cases.

### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

This repository is the central nervous system of the application. Its primary value is in decoupling the UI from the core business logic and data storage, which makes the entire system more maintainable, testable, and flexible. Its implementation must rigorously follow asynchronous patterns to ensure a responsive user experience, and its exception handling strategy is critical for overall application reliability.

# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-030

#### 3.1.1.2.0 Requirement Description

Player can configure a new game (player name, number of AI, difficulty).

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- A 'GameSessionService' will expose a 'StartNewGameAsync' method that accepts a DTO with game setup parameters.
- This service will orchestrate calls to an 'IPlayerProfileRepository' to get or create a profile and then initialize a new 'GameState' object via the Domain layer.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- GameSessionService

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement is a core use case representing the start of the application lifecycle, and the Application Services layer is responsible for orchestrating this setup process as confirmed by Sequence Diagram 183.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-038

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

A player's turn consists of distinct phases.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- A 'TurnManagementService' will manage a state machine for the current turn's phases (e.g., Pre-Roll, Roll, Main, Post-Roll).
- This service will coordinate player actions and AI decisions within the appropriate phase, ensuring game rules for turn sequence are followed.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- TurnManagementService
- AIService

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Orchestrating the sequence and flow of a turn is a classic application service responsibility. Sequence Diagram 196 (AI Turn) and 182 (Auction) show this layer managing turn-based activities.

### 3.1.3.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-059

#### 3.1.3.2.0 Requirement Description

Human and AI players can trade assets.

#### 3.1.3.3.0 Implementation Implications

- A 'TradeOrchestrationService' will handle the logic for proposing, evaluating, and executing trades.
- It will receive trade proposals, delegate AI evaluation to the Domain layer, and use the 'RuleEngine' to atomically execute the asset transfer upon acceptance.

#### 3.1.3.4.0 Required Components

- TradeOrchestrationService

#### 3.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Trading is a multi-step interaction between players that requires coordination, validation, and state mutation, making it a perfect fit for an application service. Sequence Diagrams 181, 186, and 198 confirm this responsibility.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-015: Load a game from the main menu in under 10 seconds.

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

The 'GameSessionService''s 'LoadGameAsync' method must be fully asynchronous to prevent blocking the UI. It must efficiently orchestrate the call to the underlying 'ISaveGameRepository', which will perform the I/O-intensive work.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Must use 'async/await' for all methods that orchestrate I/O operations.
- Data transfer objects (DTOs) should be used to pass data, avoiding unnecessary processing or lazy loading issues.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This layer initiates the load process, so its efficiency in orchestrating the operation is critical to meeting the performance target.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Maintainability

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-025: Unit test coverage of at least 70% for core logic.

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

All services must be designed for testability by exclusively depending on interfaces injected via the constructor. This allows for unit testing with mocked dependencies, which is essential for achieving high test coverage.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- No direct instantiation of dependencies ('new Repository()').
- All dependencies must be abstracted behind interfaces and provided via Dependency Injection.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The architecture's description explicitly calls out high testability as a goal, and this NFR quantifies it. Dependency Injection is the key enabling pattern.

### 3.2.3.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.3.1.0 Requirement Type

Reliability

#### 3.2.3.2.0 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-088: Detect corrupted save files using a checksum.

#### 3.2.3.3.0 Implementation Impact

The 'GameSessionService' must be prepared to handle a specific exception (e.g., 'DataCorruptionException') thrown by the 'ISaveGameRepository' if a checksum fails. The service should catch this exception and return a structured error result to the Presentation layer.

#### 3.2.3.4.0 Design Constraints

- Service methods should be wrapped in 'try/catch' blocks to handle exceptions from lower layers gracefully.
- Return types should be result objects (e.g., 'Result<GameState>') rather than throwing exceptions upwards to the UI layer.

#### 3.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

As the orchestrator, this layer is responsible for translating low-level data errors into a state that the application can gracefully handle, as shown in Sequence Diagram 185.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The Application Services layer is central to implementing the game's core use cases, such as game setup, turn management, and player interactions. Its design is heavily influenced by non-functional requirements, particularly the need for asynchronous operations to ensure performance, and a strict adherence to dependency inversion to guarantee testability and maintainability.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Layered Architecture

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

This repository is the implementation of the 'Application Services Layer'. It isolates the Presentation Layer from the Business Logic (Domain) and Infrastructure Layers, acting as a mediator.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- GameSessionService
- TurnManagementService
- TradeOrchestrationService
- PropertyActionService

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Create service classes that encapsulate application-specific workflows. These services will be injected with interfaces from lower layers (Domain, Infrastructure) and will be called by the Presentation Layer.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The overall system architecture is explicitly defined as Layered, and this repository's described role as the 'glue' layer perfectly matches the responsibilities of an Application Services Layer.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Repository Pattern

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

This layer is a *client* of the Repository pattern. It does not implement repositories but depends on repository interfaces (e.g., 'ISaveGameRepository', 'IStatisticsRepository') to request data persistence and retrieval.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- GameSessionService
- StatisticsService

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Services will declare dependencies on repository interfaces in their constructors. The DI container will inject the concrete implementations provided by the Infrastructure Layer at runtime.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The architectural documentation and multiple sequence diagrams (e.g., 183, 187, 188) show this layer interacting with persistence solely through repository interfaces, confirming its role as a pattern consumer.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

Asynchronous (Task-based) and Synchronous in-process method calls via Dependency Injection.

#### 4.2.1.4.0 Interface Requirements

- Requires 'IRuleEngine' from the Domain Layer.
- Requires 'ISaveGameRepository', 'IStatisticsRepository', and 'ILogger' from the Infrastructure Abstractions layer.

#### 4.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary function of the layer: to integrate and coordinate the activities of the core business logic and the technical data services.

### 4.2.2.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.2.1.0 Integration Type

Event Publication

#### 4.2.2.2.0 Target Components

- Presentation Layer

#### 4.2.2.3.0 Communication Pattern

Asynchronous, decoupled event publication/subscription via an in-process event bus.

#### 4.2.2.4.0 Interface Requirements

- Requires an 'IEventBus' interface to publish domain or application events (e.g., 'GameStateUpdatedEvent', 'AITradeOfferReceivedEvent').

#### 4.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Sequence diagrams 181 and 186 demonstrate the need for a decoupled notification mechanism to inform the UI of state changes without creating a direct dependency from the Application layer to the Presentation layer.

###### 6.1.2.4.1.2 Interaction Context

Called by the main game loop to advance the game to the next player's turn.

###### 6.1.2.4.1.3 Parameter Analysis

Accepts no parameters; operates on the current game session state.

###### 6.1.2.4.1.4 Return Type Analysis

Returns a 'Task' that completes when the turn is over.

###### 6.1.2.4.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

Manages the high-level flow of the game. It determines the current player and delegates control.

##### 6.1.2.4.2.0 Method Name

###### 6.1.2.4.2.1 Method Name

ExecuteTurnAsync

###### 6.1.2.4.2.2 Interaction Context

Called by 'TurnManagementService' when the current player is an AI.

###### 6.1.2.4.2.3 Parameter Analysis

Accepts the current 'GameState' to provide context for AI decision-making.

###### 6.1.2.4.2.4 Return Type Analysis

Returns a 'Task' that completes when the AI has finished all its actions for the turn.

###### 6.1.2.4.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

This method orchestrates the AI's turn by repeatedly querying the Domain Layer's 'AIBehaviorTreeExecutor' for actions and then dispatching those actions for validation and execution, as shown in Sequence 196.

## 6.2.0.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

### 6.2.1.0.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.1.1.0.0 Protocol Type

Dependency Injection with Asynchronous Method Calls

#### 6.2.1.2.0.0 Implementation Requirements

All services must be registered in the application's DI container. I/O-bound service methods must have 'async Task' signatures. Consumers (e.g., Presentation Layer) will 'await' these method calls.

#### 6.2.1.3.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary, direct communication method for command-style interactions, where the caller requires a direct response or confirmation of completion.

### 6.2.2.0.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.2.1.0.0 Protocol Type

In-Process Event Bus

#### 6.2.2.2.0.0 Implementation Requirements

An event bus service ('IEventBus') must be available via DI. Services will publish events (plain C# objects) after significant state changes. Subscribers (in the Presentation Layer or other services) will handle these events asynchronously.

#### 6.2.2.3.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This protocol is used for decoupled, 'fire-and-forget' notifications, ideal for updating multiple UI components after a single state change without tightly coupling the Application layer to the UI, as seen in Sequence 181 and 186.

# 7.0.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

*No items available*

# 8.0.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed using the full provided context. The repository's description and 'architecture_map' defined its scope and dependencies. The 'requirements_map' linked it to specific business functions. The 'ARCHITECTURE' document contextualized its role. 'SEQUENCE DESIGN' diagrams provided detailed, dynamic interaction models which were used to specify methods and confirm orchestration logic.

## 8.2.0.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision: Define 'GameSessionService' as the owner of REQ-1-030. Justification: Sequence 183 explicitly shows this service orchestrating the new game setup.
- Decision: Specify that all I/O-orchestrating methods must be 'async'. Justification: REQ-1-015 (performance) and modern .NET best practices mandate non-blocking operations for responsiveness.
- Decision: Conclude that this layer consumes, but does not implement, the Repository pattern. Justification: The 'architecture_map' and description state it depends on interfaces like 'ISaveGameRepository', which is the definition of a repository pattern client.

## 8.3.0.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption: The 'InProcessEventBus' shown in sequence diagrams is a required component for this layer to publish events. Validation: Multiple sequences (181, 186) show this as the mechanism for notifying the UI of state changes, confirming its necessity for decoupling.
- Assumption: Services like 'TradeOrchestrationService' and 'PropertyActionService' exist. Validation: While not in the 'components_map', the sequence diagrams (179, 181, 198) and logical separation of concerns strongly imply their existence as distinct components within this repository.

## 8.4.0.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Verification: The dependencies listed in the 'architecture_map' (e.g., 'IRuleEngine', 'ISaveGameRepository') were confirmed by observing their usage in multiple sequence diagrams (e.g., 182, 187), ensuring consistency between static architecture and dynamic behavior.
- Verification: The functional requirements from the 'requirements_map' (e.g., REQ-1-038 Turn Phases) were cross-referenced with the 'ARCHITECTURE' document's description of the Application Services Layer's responsibilities, confirming a correct placement of this logic.
