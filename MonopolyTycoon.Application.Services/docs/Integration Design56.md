- A new game session must be created with the specified configuration.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The GameSessionService must expose a method like StartNewGameAsync that accepts game setup options.
- This service will orchestrate calls to the persistence layer (to create a profile) and the domain layer (to create a GameState object).

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement is a core use case directly orchestrated by the GameSessionService within this repository, which handles the setup and initiation of new game sessions.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- The system must enforce the sequence of turn phases.
- Different actions must be permissible only in their designated phase (e.g., building houses in Pre-Roll).

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- A TurnManagementService is required to manage the state machine of a player's turn.
- This service will coordinate with the domain layer's RuleEngine to validate that actions requested by the presentation layer are valid for the current phase.

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system shall facilitate trading between the human player and AI opponents. The human player must be able to initiate a trade with any AI at any time during their turn. When an AI proposes a trade to the human, a modal dialog must be displayed with options to 'Accept', 'Decline', or 'Propose Counter-Offer'.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- A user action must trigger the trade proposal workflow.
- The workflow must be valid only during the pre-roll phase of the human player's turn.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- A dedicated TradeOrchestrationService is needed to manage the complex, multi-step trading process.
- This service will be called by the TurnManagementService and will coordinate between the UI, the domain's AI evaluation logic, and the RuleEngine for final execution.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement describes a complex application-specific use case (trading) that requires orchestration across multiple domain and UI components, making it a key responsibility for a service in this repository.

#### 1.2.4.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-080

#### 1.2.4.2 Requirement Text

The settings menu shall contain data management options to 'Reset Statistics' and 'Delete Saved Games'.

#### 1.2.4.3 Validation Criteria

- A user action in the settings menu triggers the deletion of all save game files.

#### 1.2.4.4 Implementation Implications

- An application service must expose methods to orchestrate these deletion operations.
- These methods will call the corresponding methods on the IStatisticsRepository and ISaveGameRepository interfaces.

#### 1.2.4.5 Extraction Reasoning
