Allocate a fixed percentage (e.g., 40%) of development time for rule implementation specifically to writing unit and integration tests. Utilize code coverage tools from the first sprint to track progress.",Dedicate a full ""hardening"" sprint focused solely on writing tests and fixing bugs found. Descope non-critical features (e.g., one of the two themes) to free up development time if quality targets are missed.,Code coverage reports at the end of a sprint are below 50% for the core logic library. More than 5 critical bugs related to rule enforcement are found during manual QA.,QA Lead,Ongoing,Identified
RISK-TIME-001,Timeline,"The project has a long critical path of dependencies where foundational tasks (e.g., WI-011 Turn Manager) block numerous subsequent rule implementation tasks. Any delay in these early tasks will have a cascading effect, jeopardizing the overall project schedule.",4,4,16,High,"All WIs from WI-012 to WI-017",The sequential nature of game logic development; the core game loop and state machine must be stable before features can be built on top of it.,"Assign the most senior developers to the foundational tasks (Turn Manager, Rule Engine shell). Utilize an interface-driven design so that feature developers can code against a stable API contract even before the full implementation is complete.",Re-plan sprints to parallelize work where possible (e.g., UI development using mock data). Approve focused overtime or re-assign resources to critical path tasks if they fall behind schedule.,The 'Turn Manager State Machine' (WI-011) is not completed by the end of its scheduled sprint. Any critical-path task is more than 20% over its estimated effort.,Project Manager,2025-03-15,Identified
RISK-TECH-002,Technical,"An error in the serialization/deserialization logic for the complex `GameState` object, such as a circular reference or a newly added property being missed, could lead to corrupted save files, causing players to lose all progress and severely damaging user trust.",3,5,15,High,"WI-003, WI-023, WI-024",Complexity of serializing a deep object graph with nested collections and references. Human error in maintaining serialization attributes across all data models.,"Implement a comprehensive ""round-trip"" integration test (as part of WI-023) that saves a complex game state, loads it back, and performs a deep object comparison to ensure 100% data integrity. Enforce a code review checklist item to verify serialization attributes on all data model changes.",If `System.Text.Json` proves inadequate for the object graph, switch to a more robust serialization library like Newtonsoft.Json which has better handling for complex scenarios like reference loops and type preservation.,The save/load integration test fails consistently.

Create a ""rules clarification"" document that translates the entire official rulebook into pseudo-code before implementation begins. Implement the most complex rules first to de-risk the schedule early.",Descope non-essential features (e.g., reduce the number of themes from two to one for launch, simplify some non-critical animations) to re-allocate development time to the core rule engine if it falls significantly behind schedule.,The first major rule implementation (e.g., WI-013 Property Acquisition) takes more than double its estimated time. The number of bugs found in the rule engine is disproportionately high compared to other modules.,Project Manager,2025-03-01,Identified
RISK-QUAL-002,Quality,"The tunable AI parameters in the external JSON file may be difficult to balance, resulting in difficulty levels that do not match player expectations (e.g., 'Hard' is too easy, or 'Easy' is frustratingly random), leading to a poor gameplay experience.",4,3,12,Medium,"WI-019, WI-020, WI-021",Game balancing is an iterative and subjective process that requires extensive playtesting, which is time-consuming and can be difficult to quantify.,"Schedule dedicated, recurring playtesting sessions throughout the development cycle specifically for AI feedback. Create internal tools to run AI vs. AI simulations at high speed to gather large-scale statistical data on performance and strategy viability.",If balancing the 'Hard' AI proves too difficult, launch with only 'Easy' and 'Medium' difficulties, and label the 'Hard' difficulty as 'Experimental' or plan to release it in a post-launch update after more feedback.,Playtester feedback consistently indicates a mismatch between the selected difficulty and the perceived challenge. Statistical analysis of AI vs. AI games shows one strategy is overwhelmingly dominant across all configurations.,Game Designer,Ongoing,Identified

Define a strict set of .NET features and patterns that are confirmed to be compatible and performant within Unity.",If persistent issues arise, merge the core logic back into the main Unity project's Assembly Definition (`.asmdef`) files. This sacrifices some testing purity for guaranteed compatibility and simpler workflow.,Build times increase significantly due to library referencing issues. Debugging across the library boundary proves to be unreliable or overly complex.,Lead Developer,2025-02-20,Identified

Lack of communication with the licensor.,Establish a regular (e.g., bi-weekly) check-in process with the Hasbro liaison. Submit key assets (logo, board design, UI mockups, token models) for early, informal review before full implementation or final polishing.,Allocate a buffer in the project schedule and budget specifically for compliance-related rework. Ensure all art assets are created in a modular way (e.g., using layered files) to facilitate easier changes.,Feedback from Hasbro indicates a significant deviation from their expectations. A formal review is delayed by the licensor, pushing feedback closer to the release date.,Producer,Ongoing,Identified
RISK-QUAL-003,Quality,"The rule for building auctions during a housing shortage (US-037) is a complex and rarely encountered edge case, making it difficult to test thoroughly. A bug in this logic could stall or crash the game in late-game scenarios.",2,3,6,Low,"WI-014, related UI work",The specific game state required to trigger this rule is hard to achieve through normal gameplay, leading to a lack of testing.,Create a dedicated, curated save file (as part of WI-024) that sets up the exact conditions for a building shortage auction. This save file must be used for a specific manual test case and a new integration test.,If the auction logic proves too unstable near release, replace it with a simpler rule (e.g., ""first come, first served"" for the current player) and document this as a known deviation from the official rules, to be patched later.,Manual QA is unable to trigger the building auction scenario after multiple attempts. The integration test for this scenario is flaky or fails intermittently.,QA Lead,2025-05-15,Identified
