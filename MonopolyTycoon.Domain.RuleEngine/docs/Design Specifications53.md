# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary: Implement the complete, official rules of Monopoly in a pure, stateless manner, acting as the definitive source of truth for game logic validation.
- Secondary: Provide a cryptographically secure dice rolling mechanism as required by REQ-1-042.
- Exclusion: Explicitly excludes any direct interaction with UI, database, file system, networking, or AI-specific decision-making logic.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- .NET 8 Class Library
- C# 12

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must be a stateless service; all required game state must be passed as input parameters for every operation.
- Must have zero dependencies on infrastructure or presentation layers to ensure portability and high testability.
- All business rule validations must return structured result objects rather than throwing exceptions for predictable, invalid game actions.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

In-memory method calls via a dependency-injected interface (e.g., IRuleEngine).

##### 2.1.4.2.4 Reasoning

The Application Services Layer orchestrates game flow and delegates all rule validation and state change calculations to this repository to enforce separation of concerns.

### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

This repository represents the logical core of the game's mechanics. Its strict isolation and statelessness are its most critical architectural features, directly enabling the high testability required by REQ-1-025. The complexity lies entirely in the accurate and comprehensive implementation of intricate Monopoly rules.

# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-003

#### 3.1.1.2.0 Requirement Description

System must strictly implement and enforce the official rules of Monopoly.

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- A central 'RuleEngine' class will serve as a facade for all rule-related operations.
- Methods will be designed to be pure functions, taking the current state and an action, and returning the result or new state.
- Requires exhaustive modeling of all game rules, including rent, purchases, auctions, jail, taxes, and property development.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- RuleEngine

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary charter of the repository. The entire design is centered around creating a verifiable and isolated implementation of the game's rule set.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-042

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

Dice rolls must use a cryptographically secure random number generator.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- A 'DiceRoller' service must be implemented using 'System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator'.
- The service will be consumed by the RuleEngine to generate dice roll results.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- DiceRoller
- RuleEngine

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This security requirement mandates a specific implementation detail within the domain, separating it from standard, less secure RNGs.

### 3.1.3.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-054

#### 3.1.3.2.0 Requirement Description

When a building shortage occurs, an auction must be held for the remaining buildings.

#### 3.1.3.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The RuleEngine's logic for property development must check bank inventory.
- If a shortage is detected, the engine must return a specific result indicating an auction is necessary, which the Application Layer will then orchestrate.

#### 3.1.3.4.0 Required Components

- RuleEngine

#### 3.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This represents a complex, state-dependent business rule that must be handled by the core engine to ensure fair play according to official rules.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

- {'requirement_type': 'Testability', 'requirement_specification': 'Unit test coverage of at least 70% for core logic (REQ-1-025).', 'implementation_impact': "This NFR is the primary driver for the repository's stateless, dependency-free architecture. Every design decision must support easy instantiation and execution of logic in a testing context.", 'design_constraints': ['No direct instantiation of dependencies; use interfaces and DI (even if only for testing).', 'Avoid static classes and methods where state or behavior needs to be mocked.'], 'analysis_reasoning': 'The architectural choice to make this a pure, stateless library is a direct tactical response to this high-test-coverage requirement.'}

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The repository is defined by a small number of critical requirements. REQ-1-003 dictates its entire functional scope, while REQ-1-025 dictates its architecture. All other requirements are specific features within the broader rule set.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Layered Architecture

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

This repository is a canonical example of the Business Logic (Domain) Layer, completely isolated from Presentation, Application, and Infrastructure concerns.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- RuleEngine

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

The repository will be a .NET 8 class library with no project references to any other layer except the core Domain Model project (REPO-DM-001).

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This strict layering enforces separation of concerns, ensuring the core game rules can be evolved and tested independently of the rest of the system.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Stateless Service

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

The 'RuleEngine' component will be implemented as a stateless service. It will not maintain any session state between method calls.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- RuleEngine

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

All methods on the RuleEngine will accept a 'GameState' object as a parameter, containing all necessary context for the operation. Methods will return a result object or a new GameState instance.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern simplifies the logic, eliminates a whole class of state-related bugs, improves predictability, and enhances testability, which is a key NFR.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

- {'integration_type': 'Internal Service Call', 'target_components': ['Application Services Layer', 'MonopolyTycoon.Domain.RuleEngine'], 'communication_pattern': 'Synchronous, In-Memory Method Calls', 'interface_requirements': ["An 'IRuleEngine' interface will define the public contract for the RuleEngine.", 'Method signatures will use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) or domain models for parameters and return types (e.g., Action objects, Result objects).'], 'analysis_reasoning': "This is the primary integration pattern, where application use cases (e.g., 'Player takes turn') orchestrate calls to the RuleEngine to enforce game rules."}

- {'entity_name': 'N/A', 'database_table': 'N/A', 'required_properties': ['This repository does not perform any entity-to-database mapping.'], 'relationship_mappings': ['N/A'], 'access_patterns': ['Access to domain entities is through in-memory object references passed into its methods.'], 'analysis_reasoning': "The repository's architectural constraints explicitly forbid direct data persistence. Its data source is the in-memory 'GameState' object graph, making traditional database analysis inapplicable."}

## 5.2.0.0.0 Data Access Requirements

- {'operation_type': 'In-Memory State Mutation', 'required_methods': ['Methods that take a GameState, apply a rule, and return a result or a new, modified GameState.'], 'performance_constraints': 'Algorithms for rule validation must be highly performant to support rapid AI turn simulations without causing gameplay delays.', 'analysis_reasoning': 'Data access is redefined as in-memory object graph traversal and manipulation. Performance is a key concern, but it relates to algorithmic complexity rather than I/O latency.'}

# 6.0.0.0.0 Sequence Analysis

## 6.1.0.0.0 Interaction Patterns

### 6.1.1.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.1.1.0 Sequence Name

Rent Collection (ID: 202)

#### 6.1.1.2.0 Repository Role

The RuleEngine acts as the calculator and validator for the rent transaction.

#### 6.1.1.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IRuleEngine

#### 6.1.1.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'CalculateAndApplyRent', 'interaction_context': "Called by the TurnManagementService after a player's token movement is complete and they have landed on an opponent's property.", 'parameter_analysis': "Input: the current 'GameState', the 'Player' who landed, and the 'Property' they landed on.", 'return_type_analysis': "Output: A 'RentResult' object indicating the outcome (e.g., success, property mortgaged, insufficient funds leading to bankruptcy).", 'analysis_reasoning': 'This method encapsulates the complex logic of calculating rent (based on monopoly status, houses, hotels, etc.) and ensures the transaction is valid according to game rules.'}

#### 6.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This sequence demonstrates the classic role of the RuleEngine: an application service provides high-level context, and the engine executes the detailed, state-dependent rule.

### 6.1.2.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.2.1.0 Sequence Name

Player Bankruptcy (ID: 174)

#### 6.1.2.2.0 Repository Role

The RuleEngine is responsible for determining if a player is bankrupt and for executing the correct asset transfer logic.

#### 6.1.2.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IRuleEngine

#### 6.1.2.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'ResolveBankruptcy', 'interaction_context': 'Called by an application service when a player cannot pay a required debt.', 'parameter_analysis': "Input: the current 'GameState', the 'Player' who is bankrupt, and the 'Creditor' (which can be another player or the bank).", 'return_type_analysis': "Output: A 'BankruptcyResult' DTO containing the new 'GameState' after all assets have been transferred according to the rules (e.g., assets go to creditor player, or assets are auctioned if creditor is the bank).", 'analysis_reasoning': 'This method handles one of the most critical state transitions in the game, enforcing the different outcomes for bankruptcy to a player versus the bank (REQ-1-065, REQ-1-066).'}

#### 6.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This sequence highlights the engine's role as the sole authority for complex, game-altering state mutations, ensuring the rules are applied atomically and correctly.

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

- {'protocol_type': 'In-Memory Method Calls', 'implementation_requirements': 'All interactions are direct C# method invocations. No serialization or network communication is involved. The repository will be consumed as a referenced project.', 'analysis_reasoning': 'Given the tight coupling required between application orchestration and rule validation, this high-performance, in-process communication is the only appropriate choice.'}

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

- {'finding_category': 'Architectural Mismatch', 'finding_description': "The 'Behavior Tree Framework' enhancement instructions provided in the context are not applicable to this specific repository. The repository's description explicitly states it was created to ISOLATE the core rules from other concerns like AI, which is where Behavior Trees are used.", 'implementation_impact': "Positive. Developers should IGNORE the Behavior Tree instructions for this repository and focus exclusively on the '.NET 8 Business Logic' guidelines, which align perfectly with the repository's stated purpose and architecture.", 'priority_level': 'High', 'analysis_reasoning': 'Applying the wrong architectural guidance would pollute the pure, technology-agnostic nature of the rule engine, violating its primary constraints and coupling it unnecessarily with AI implementation details.'}

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis utilized all provided context sections: REQUIREMENTS for functional scope, ARCHITECTURE for placement and patterns, DETABASE DESIGN (by exclusion), SEQUENCE DESIGN for interaction contracts, and repository-specific description for constraints and purpose.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Identified repository as pure domain logic from description.
- Confirmed stateless nature from architecture and sequence diagrams.
- Cross-referenced REQ-1-025 with architectural constraints to confirm testability as a primary driver.
- Dismissed Behavior Tree enhancement instructions as inapplicable based on conflicting repository description.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption that 'MonopolyTycoon.Domain' (REPO-DM-001) provides the complete and correct 'GameState' model was validated by the 'architecture_map' dependency.
- Assumption of statelessness was validated by analyzing method signatures in sequence diagrams which consistently pass state as a parameter.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Repository description's 'stateless' and 'technology-agnostic' claims were verified against the Layered Architecture document.
- Requirement REQ-1-042 (Secure RNG) was confirmed as a component responsibility within this repository.
- Integration patterns described in the 'architecture_map' were consistent with interactions shown in sequence diagrams (e.g., in-memory calls).
