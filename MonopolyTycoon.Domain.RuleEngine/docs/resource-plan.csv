T-US005-2,"Implement Rolling File and Retention Policy",Backend Development,DevOps,Low,4,Mid,1,"US-005, T-US005-1",Yes,"Requires correct configuration of the Serilog sink. Incorrect paths or policies can lead to log spam or no logs at all.",Use a simpler, non-rolling log file for initial development and add the retention policy later, but this risks filling up user disk space.
T-US005-3,"Implement Global Exception Handler Hook",Backend Development,"",Low,4.33,Senior,1,"US-005, T-US005-1",Yes,"Core architectural piece. Requires a senior developer to ensure it's implemented robustly at the application root.",Rely only on Unity's `Application.logMessageReceived` for a simpler implementation, but this may miss exceptions on non-Unity threads.
T-US005-4,"Develop Minimalist Error Modal UI Prefab",Frontend Development,Design,Medium,6.67,Mid,1,US-005,Yes,"The UI must be self-contained and not rely on any game-wide managers that could have crashed.",Use a basic, unstyled UI prefab initially to unblock the logic development, and apply visual polish later.
T-US005-5,"Implement Error Handling Data Flow and Logic",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,10,Senior,1,"US-005, T-US005-1, T-US005-3, T-US005-4",Yes,"Integrates the logging service, exception hook, and UI. Requires careful implementation to ensure the handler itself does not fail.",Instead of generating a random ID, use the exception's hash code as the correlation ID. This is less unique but simpler to implement.
US-008,"Start a new game from the main menu",Frontend Development,Design,Low,1,Junior,1,E-04,Yes,"Primary user entry point into the game. Must be simple and reliable.",Have the game load directly into the setup screen on startup for development builds to bypass the main menu and speed up testing.

Requires a robust, event-driven update mechanism.",Update the HUD only at the start of each player's turn instead of real-time, reducing the number of UI updates and simplifying the logic.
US-009,"Configure a game with one to three AI opponents",Frontend Development,"",Low,1,Junior,1,"E-04, US-008",Yes,"Core game configuration option.",Hardcode the number of opponents to 2 (1 human, 1 AI) to simplify the setup screen and game initialization logic.
US-010,"Set a unique difficulty level for each AI opponent",Frontend Development,Backend Development,Low,3,Mid,1,"E-04, US-009",Yes,"Key feature for replayability and tuning challenge.",Provide a single, global difficulty setting for all AI opponents instead of individual settings to simplify the UI.
US-019,"Collect $200 salary when passing or landing on GO",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Low,1,Junior,1,"E-02, US-016, US-049",Yes,"Fundamental game rule. Logic is a simple check during the movement phase.",Delay visual/audio feedback for the salary collection and just update the cash value to save on animation/sound design effort.
US-030,"Choose to buy an unowned property I land on",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-03, US-016, US-050",Yes,"Core property acquisition mechanic. Requires a modal dialog to pause the game for player input.",If the player has enough cash, automatically buy the property without a prompt to simplify the game flow, but this removes player agency.
US-045,"Automatically pay rent when I land on an opponent's property",Backend Development,Quality Assurance,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-02, US-016, US-030, US-033, US-038, US-047",Yes,"Complex rule calculation with many edge cases (monopolies, houses, mortgages). Requires extensive testing.",Implement only the base rent logic first, and add the multipliers for monopolies and houses in a later iteration.
US-044,"Automatically collect rent when an opponent lands on my property",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-03, US-016, US-030, US-033, US-038, US-047",Yes,"This is the inverse of paying rent (US-045) and shares the same complex calculation logic.",This feature must be implemented in lock-step with US-045; no alternative approach is viable without breaking the game's economy.

US-017,"Receive an extra turn after rolling doubles",Backend Development,Quality Assurance,Low,2,Mid,1,"E-02, US-015, US-022",Yes,"Core game rule. Modifies the turn manager's state machine.",This is a fundamental rule; a viable alternative would be to remove it, but this significantly alters the game and violates REQ-1-003.
US-018,"Be sent to jail for rolling three consecutive doubles",Backend Development,Quality Assurance,Low,2,Mid,1,"E-02, US-017",Yes,"Core game rule, tightly coupled with the doubles logic from US-017.",Same as US-017; removing this rule would violate the core requirement of adhering to official rules.
US-020,"Get out of jail by paying the $50 fine",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Low,1,Junior,1,"E-02, US-018, US-049",Yes,"Core game rule. Part of the jail-mechanic choice system.",Combine all jail options into a single, automated decision for the AI to simplify the UI and logic for the player. This removes player agency.
US-021,"Get out of jail by using a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card",Backend Development,Backend Development,Low,2,Mid,1,"E-02, US-018, US-024, US-025",Yes,"Core game rule. Involves both player state and deck state management.",Have the card be used automatically on the player's next turn in jail, removing the choice but simplifying the logic.
US-022,"Attempt to get out of jail by rolling for doubles",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Low,3,Mid,1,"E-02, US-015, US-018",Yes,"Core game rule. The main chance-based way to escape jail.",This is a fundamental rule and has no simple alternative without changing the game's nature.
US-024,"Draw a Chance card when landing on a Chance space",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-02, US-016, US-018, US-019, US-047",Yes,"Core game mechanic with many varied outcomes. Requires a flexible card-effect system.",Implement only the monetary-based cards first and add movement/special cards later to reduce initial complexity.
US-025,"Draw a Community Chest card when landing on a Community Chest space",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-02, US-016, US-018, US-047",Yes,"Similar to Chance cards. Shares the same underlying system.",Implement in lock-step with US-024 as they will use the same card execution engine.
US-028,"Experience no gameplay effect when landing on Free Parking",Backend Development,"",Low,1,Junior,1,"E-02, US-015, US-016, US-017",Yes,"Official rule is a 'no-op'. Simple to implement.",Many 'house rules' add a cash payout here. Implementing a house rule would violate REQ-1-003 and REQ-1-008.
US-023,"Be forced to pay the fine after failing to roll doubles for 3 turns in jail",Backend Development,Quality Assurance,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-02, US-022, US-038, US-047",Yes,"Complex edge case of the jail mechanic that must integrate with the bankruptcy system.",Simply force the player out of jail on the third turn without payment. This simplifies logic but is a major rule deviation.
US-026,"Choose to pay $200 or 10% of my net worth for Income Tax",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-02, US-016, US-038, US-047",Yes,"Requires a net worth calculation and a player decision modal.",Make the tax a single fixed amount (e.g., $200) to remove the calculation and player choice, simplifying the interaction.
US-027,"Pay a fixed Luxury Tax amount",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Low,2,Junior,1,"E-02, US-016, US-038, US-047",Yes,"Simple, automatic transaction. Main complexity is the integration with bankruptcy.",No viable alternative, as this is a simple, core board space action.
US-029,"Manage my properties before rolling the dice",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-02, US-015, US-033, US-038, US-040",Yes,"Defines a key phase in the player's turn. Requires a robust turn state machine.",Allow property management at any time during the player's turn, not just pre-roll. This is simpler but less authentic to the board game.
US-033,"Build houses on properties in a complete color set",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-03, US-030, US-034, US-036, US-052",Yes,"Core economic mechanic. Validation logic is moderately complex.",No viable alternative without fundamentally changing the game's strategy.
US-034,"Enforce even building rule for property development",Backend Development,Quality Assurance,Medium,5,Senior,1,"E-03, US-033, US-052",Yes,"Complex validation logic that is a common source of bugs in Monopoly implementations. Requires a senior developer's attention.",Remove the rule and allow players to build on any property in a monopoly. This would drastically unbalance the game but simplify the logic.
US-035,"Upgrade a set of 4 houses to a single hotel",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-03, US-033, US-034",Yes,"The final step in property development. Logic builds upon the house-building system.",No viable alternative, as this is a core part of the property development path.
US-036,"Notify player of building shortage when attempting to build",Frontend Development,Backend Development,Low,2,Junior,1,"E-03, US-033, US-052",Yes,"Important UI feedback for a core economic constraint.",Don't provide proactive feedback (disabled buttons), only a reactive error message. This is a slightly worse UX but simpler to implement.
US-038,"Mortgage an undeveloped property to get cash",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Low,3,Mid,1,"E-03, US-044, US-052",Yes,"Key financial mechanic for players to avoid bankruptcy.",No viable alternative, as this is a critical player action for financial management.

Can be complex to display all information clearly.",Instead of a dedicated screen, have players click individual properties on the board to manage them. This is more cumbersome but requires less UI design.
US-031,"Choose to send an unowned property to auction instead of buying it",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Low,2,Junior,1,"E-03, US-030, US-032",Yes,"Core rule that adds strategic depth.",Remove the auction mechanic entirely. If a player declines to buy, the property remains unowned. This violates REQ-1-003.
US-032,"Participate in an auction for a property",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Senior,1,"E-03, US-031",Yes,"Complex sub-system with its own turn-based loop. Requires AI logic for bidding.",Simplify the auction to a single round of sealed bids instead of a multi-round verbal auction. This is faster but less strategic.
US-040,"Initiate a trade with an AI opponent during my turn",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-03, US-032, US-052, US-053",Yes,"Key strategic player interaction.

US-041,"Respond to a trade offer from an AI opponent",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-03, US-032, US-040, US-053",Yes,"Makes the AI feel more proactive and engaging. Uses the same UI as player-initiated trades.",Disable AI-initiated trades and only allow the player to start negotiations. This simplifies AI logic but makes them feel more passive.
US-042,"Propose a counter-offer to an AI's trade proposal",Frontend Development,Backend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-03, US-041, US-053",Yes,"Adds significant depth to the trading negotiation loop.",Limit the player to only 'Accept' or 'Decline'. The player would have to manually initiate a new trade to counter, which is a worse UX but simpler logic.
US-043,"Receive a non-intrusive notification when AI players trade with each other",Frontend Development,"",Low,2,Junior,1,"E-04, US-010, US-040",No,"Important for player's situational awareness.",Don't show any notification. This is simpler but can be frustrating for the player who may not notice a key monopoly has been formed.
US-053,"Use a two-panel interface to build and review trade offers",Frontend Development,Design,Medium,8,Senior,1,"E-04, US-040, US-041, US-042",Yes,"Complex UI that must clearly display a lot of information. Needs a senior frontend developer or dedicated UI designer.",Use a simpler, form-based UI where players select items from dropdowns. This is less intuitive but easier to build than a drag-and-drop or two-panel click system.
US-037,"Participate in an auction for the last available buildings",Backend Development,Frontend Development,High,13,Senior,1,"E-03, US-033, US-034, US-036",No,"Very complex edge case rule. Requires a separate auction system from property auctions and complex AI bidding logic.",Ignore this official rule, as it's an edge case. If there's a shortage, building is simply blocked. This violates REQ-1-003 but saves significant development effort.
US-046,"See a victory screen when I am the last player remaining",Frontend Development,Backend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-02, US-011, US-047, US-048, US-064",Yes,"Provides a satisfying conclusion to the game loop. Requires calculating and displaying final stats.",Show a simple text message ('You Win!') and immediately return to the main menu, deferring the detailed stats to the Game Summary screen.
US-047,"See a game-over screen when I go bankrupt",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-02, US-045, US-048",Yes,"Provides clear feedback on the loss condition. The high-speed AI simulation is the main complexity.",Instead of simulating the rest of the game, end the match immediately upon player bankruptcy and show the final standings as they were at that moment.
US-048,"View a detailed game summary screen after a match ends",Frontend Development,Backend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-04, US-013, US-046, US-047",Yes,"UI must dynamically display stats for 2-4 players.

US-002,"Choose a custom installation directory",DevOps,"",Low,1,Mid,1,"E-01, US-001",Yes,"Standard feature for PC applications.",Remove the option and always install to the default Program Files directory. This is a worse user experience but simplifies the installer script.
US-003,"Provide an option to create a desktop shortcut during installation",DevOps,"",Low,1,Mid,1,"E-01, US-001",No,"Standard feature for PC applications.",Always create the shortcut without giving the user an option. This is simpler but removes user choice.
US-006,"Uninstall the game cleanly from my computer",DevOps,Quality Assurance,Low,2,Mid,1,"E-01, US-001, US-007",Yes,"Essential for a professional product.",Provide a basic uninstaller that only removes the application files, leaving user data and registry entries behind. This is a poor practice but faster to script.
US-007,"Choose to keep my personal data upon uninstallation",DevOps,Backend Development,Low,2,Mid,1,"E-01, US-006, US-061",Yes,"Improves user experience for players who might reinstall.",Always delete all data on uninstall, or always keep all data.

Users would have to delete save files one-by-one or find them in the file system.
US-063,"Continue playing my saved games from older versions of the application",Backend Development,Quality Assurance,High,5,Senior,1,"E-06, US-062",No,"Complex and high-risk feature. Requires careful planning of the save file schema from the beginning.",Mark old save files as 'Incompatible' and require the player to start a new game after an update. This is a poor UX but avoids the risk of corrupting player data.
US-064,"View a list of my top 10 victories",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Low,2,Mid,1,"E-06, US-011, US-046, US-048",No,"Requires database queries and a dedicated UI screen.",Don't implement a Top 10 list. The player can only see their overall aggregated statistics.
US-065,"Export my top score history to a text file",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Low,1,Junior,1,"E-06, US-064",No,"A 'nice-to-have' feature for sharing.",Don't implement the export feature. This has a very low impact on the core game experience.
US-054,"Access an in-game settings menu",Frontend Development,Backend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-04, US-049",Yes,"Essential for in-game adjustments. Requires a robust system to pause/resume the game state.",Require players to return to the main menu to change settings. This is a much worse UX but simplifies the in-game state management.
US-055,"Adjust the game speed to make animations faster or instant",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,5,Mid,1,"E-04, US-054, US-061, US-062",Yes,"Key QoL feature.
