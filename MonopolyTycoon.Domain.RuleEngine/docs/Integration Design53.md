## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-003

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system's core game logic shall strictly implement and enforce the official rules of the standard U.S. Monopoly board game.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- All player actions are validated against the official rulebook.
- Game state transitions (e.g., bankruptcy, rent payment) follow official procedures.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- This repository must expose a stateless service that acts as the single source of truth for all game rules.
- The integration with the Application Services layer will be a request-response pattern where the service is asked to validate an action or apply a state change.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is the primary functional requirement for the repository, defining its core purpose. The integration design must expose a contract that allows other layers to consume this rule enforcement capability.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-025

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system's core logic, including the rule engine...shall be accompanied by a suite of unit tests...achieving a minimum of 70% code coverage.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Code coverage reports for the RuleEngine component must meet or exceed 70%.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The integration contract must be stateless and dependency-free (other than domain models) to facilitate isolated unit testing.
- Methods must be designed as pure functions where possible (input state -> output state) to be easily testable.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This non-functional requirement dictates the architectural style of the repository's integration. The stateless, dependency-free service pattern is a direct result of the need for high testability.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-042

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system shall simulate dice rolls by generating two independent random integers between 1 and 6. The random number generation must use a cryptographically secure algorithm.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Code inspection confirms the use of a cryptographically secure RNG.
- Statistical analysis of a large number of rolls shows a uniform distribution.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The repository must expose a dedicated service contract (e.g., IDiceRoller) for this functionality.
- The implementation must be isolated from other game rules to be independently verifiable.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement mandates a specific, high-quality implementation of a core game mechanic, which must be exposed as a service for consumption by the Application Services layer.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

### 1.3.1.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.1.1 Component Name

RuleEngine

#### 1.3.1.2 Component Specification

A pure, stateless service that validates proposed player actions against the official game rules and calculates the resulting game state. It acts as the functional core of the game's mechanics.

#### 1.3.1.3 Implementation Requirements

- Must be implemented as a stateless class exposing the IRuleEngine interface.
- Must not mutate the input GameState object; instead, it must return a new, modified GameState instance.
- Must return explicit ValidationResult objects for illegal actions rather than throwing exceptions for predictable rule violations.

#### 1.3.1.4 Architectural Context

Belongs to the Business Logic Layer. It encapsulates the core domain rules, independent of any other application concern.

#### 1.3.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is the primary component of the repository, as stated in its description and required by REQ-1-003. It's the main service consumed by the Application Layer.

### 1.3.2.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.2.1 Component Name

DiceRoller

#### 1.3.2.2 Component Specification

A service responsible for generating fair and unpredictable dice rolls using a cryptographically secure random number generator, fulfilling REQ-1-042.

#### 1.3.2.3 Implementation Requirements

- Must implement the IDiceRoller interface.
- Must use System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator internally.

#### 1.3.2.4 Architectural Context

Belongs to the Business Logic Layer. It provides a core game mechanic service consumed by the Application Services Layer.

#### 1.3.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This component is explicitly required by REQ-1-042 and is described as a core part of this repository's responsibilities.

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Business Logic Layer', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Contains the core logic and rules of the Monopoly game. This repository implements the stateless rule validation and state transition part of this layer.', 'layer_constraints': ['Must be completely technology-agnostic, with no dependencies on UI, databases, logging, or file I/O.', 'Must be highly portable and testable in isolation.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Stateless Service', 'Functional Approach (Pure Functions for state changes)'], 'extraction_reasoning': 'The repository is explicitly defined as a Business Logic component. Its integration design must reflect its role as a pure, isolated logic provider within the Layered Architecture.'}

## 1.5.0.0 Dependency Interfaces

- {'interface_name': 'Domain Models (GameState, PlayerState, etc.)', 'source_repository': 'REPO-DM-001', 'method_contracts': [], 'integration_pattern': 'Direct Project Reference', 'communication_protocol': 'In-Memory Object Reference', 'extraction_reasoning': "This repository's entire purpose is to operate on the canonical data models of the game. It consumes the `GameState` and its constituent classes as parameters for all its methods. This dependency is fundamental and defines the data contract for all operations."}
