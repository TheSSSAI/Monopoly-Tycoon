MonopolyTycoon.Domain.RuleEngine

# 3 Description

This repository contains the pure, stateless implementation of the official Monopoly game rules, as mandated by REQ-1-003. It was extracted from the original `MonopolyTycoon.Domain` to isolate the complex, critical business logic from other domain concerns like AI. Its primary component, the `RuleEngine`, takes the current `GameState` and a proposed action, validates it, and returns the resulting state changes. It is completely technology-agnostic, with no dependencies on Unity, databases, or file I/O. This strict isolation makes it highly testable, ensuring the 70% unit test coverage requirement (REQ-1-025) can be met and validated independently of the rest of the system. It also contains the cryptographically secure dice roller (REQ-1-042), forming the logical core of the game's mechanics.

# 24.0.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 24.1.0.0 Must Implement

- All gameplay mechanics as defined by the official 2024 US Monopoly rulebook (REQ-1-003).
- Stateless validation and state transition functions.
- A secure dice rolling mechanism (REQ-1-042).

## 24.2.0.0 Must Not Implement

- Game flow orchestration or turn management (this is an Application Service responsibility).
- Player input handling.
- Any form of I/O, including logging or data persistence.
- AI decision-making logic.

## 24.3.0.0 Extension Points

- New rules (e.g., for house rules, though out of scope for V1) could be added via a strategy pattern.

## 24.4.0.0 Validation Rules

- All validation logic for player actions (e.g., 'even build' rule REQ-1-054) must be contained within this component.
