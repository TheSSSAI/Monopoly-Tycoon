TASK-2105-04,"Implement Card Deck Service (Chance & Community Chest)",Backend Development,N/A,Medium,7.17,Mid,1,TASK-2003-02,Yes,"The shuffling logic must be robust. The service must correctly handle the 'Get Out of Jail Free' card being held by a player and not returned to the deck.","Hardcode the card order for testing, but use a simple `List.OrderBy(g => Guid.NewGuid())` for shuffling in release. This is not a truly random shuffle."
TASK-2105-05,"Implement Card Action Executor",Backend Development,N/A,High,12,Senior,1,TASK-2105-04,Yes,"A senior developer should use a scalable pattern like the Command Pattern, where each card action is a separate class, rather than a giant switch statement.","Use a single large switch statement to handle all card actions.

TASK-2104-02,"Implement Building and Selling Transactions",Backend Development,N/A,High,10.17,Mid,1,TASK-2104-01,Yes,"Transactions must be atomic. For example, when buying a hotel, player cash is debited, bank hotel supply is decremented, AND bank house supply is incremented by 4, all in one operation.","Perform state changes sequentially without a transaction wrapper.

TASK-4002-05,"Implement AI Leaf Nodes for Trading",Backend Development,N/A,Critical,17,Senior,1,"TASK-4001-01,TASK-4002-01",Yes,"This is the most complex AI task. The trade evaluation logic requires a heuristic scoring system to value properties based on their potential to complete monopolies for itself or block opponents. A senior AI developer is essential.","AI only accepts trades that give it a clear and immediate net positive cash value.
