# 1 Diagram Info

## 1.1 Diagram Name

Monopoly Tycoon - High-Level System Architecture

## 1.2 Diagram Type

graph

## 1.3 Purpose

This diagram illustrates the high-level, layered architecture of the Monopoly Tycoon application. It defines the primary components, their responsibilities, and the strict dependency flow, ensuring a clear separation of concerns between the user interface, application orchestration, core business logic, and infrastructure services.

# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Human Player
- Presentation Layer
- Application Services Layer
- Domain Logic Layer
- Infrastructure Layer
- Local Data Systems (SQLite, JSON files)

## 3.2 Key Processes

- User Input Handling
- Command Orchestration
- Business Rule Enforcement
- Game State Mutation
- Data Persistence and Retrieval

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Rule validations within the Domain Layer.
- AI decision-making within the AI Behavior Tree.

## 3.4 Success Paths

- A clear, unidirectional flow of commands from the UI down to the Infrastructure layer, with data and events flowing back up to inform the UI.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- File I/O or database exceptions are handled within the Infrastructure Layer and logged.
- Invalid user actions are caught by the Application Services Layer after validation by the Domain Layer, preventing invalid state changes.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- The decoupled architecture allows each layer to handle its own edge cases (e.g., UI handles various aspect ratios, Infrastructure handles file corruption).
