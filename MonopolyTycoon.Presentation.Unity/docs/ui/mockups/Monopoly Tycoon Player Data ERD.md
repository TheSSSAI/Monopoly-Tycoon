# 1 Diagram Info

## 1.1 Diagram Name

Monopoly Tycoon Player Data ERD

## 1.2 Diagram Type

erDiagram

## 1.3 Purpose

To illustrate the relational database schema for the local SQLite database that stores all persistent player data. This includes player profiles, their aggregated statistics, historical game results with participants, and metadata for saved game slots. It fulfills requirements for replayability and player progression (REQ-1-006, REQ-1-033, REQ-1-089).

# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- SQLite Database

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Storing a new player profile.
- Aggregating and updating player statistics.
- Recording the outcome of a completed game.
- Storing metadata for a game save file.

## 3.3 Decision Points

## 3.4 Success Paths

- A complete game session is recorded, updating PlayerStatistic and creating new GameResult and GameParticipant records.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Database corruption, which is handled by the application's backup and recovery mechanism (REQ-1-089).

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- A one-to-one relationship between a profile and its aggregate statistics is explicitly defined using a unique foreign key.
