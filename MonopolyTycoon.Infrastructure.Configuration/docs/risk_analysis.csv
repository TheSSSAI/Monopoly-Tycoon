RISK-TECH-001,Technical,"Complex integration between Unity's Presentation Layer and the separate .NET Core Logic library could lead to performance bottlenecks, state synchronization bugs, and development overhead.",4,5,20,High,"WI-001, WI-011, WI-012, WI-022, WI-025","The architecture separates engine-dependent code from pure C# logic, creating a communication boundary that must be carefully managed (events vs. direct calls).",_x000D_
1.  **Architectural Spike**: Dedicate the initial phase to building a Proof-of-Concept (POC) that validates the communication pattern (e.g., an event bus or a message queue) between Unity and the core logic library._x000D_
2.  **Define Clear Data Contracts**: Strictly define the Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) used to pass information between layers to minimize coupling._x000D_
3.  **Establish a Uni-Directional Data Flow**: Enforce a pattern where Unity views only read from the GameState and send user input as commands to the application layer, which is the only layer allowed to mutate state. ,"If the chosen communication pattern proves too slow or complex, revert to a simpler, more coupled model for non-critical updates. Accept the reduced testability in exchange for stability and performance. Allocate extra time for integration testing.",_x000D_
-   Performance profiling shows more than 5% of frame time is spent on inter-assembly communication._x000D_

RISK-TECH-002,Technical,"The AI Behavior Tree (BT) is highly complex, and the logic for different difficulty levels may be difficult to balance, resulting in an AI that feels either too predictable, unfair, or unintelligent.",4,4,16,High,"WI-018, WI-019, WI-020","AI behavior is not just a coding problem but a design and tuning challenge. Achieving a 'fun' opponent requires extensive iteration and subjective feedback.",_x000D_
1.  **Data-Driven Design**: Fully commit to externalizing all AI parameters in the `ai_config.json` file from day one to allow for rapid tuning without recompiling._x000D_
2.  **Modular BT Nodes**: Design small, reusable, and easily testable BT nodes for specific actions (e.g., `CanAffordProperty`, `ShouldBidOnMonopolyProperty`)._x000D_
3.  **Early Playtesting**: Integrate a basic AI early and begin playtesting with different parameter sets to gather feedback on what feels right. ,"If BTs prove too complex to debug or maintain, simplify the AI logic to a utility-based scoring system for high-priority decisions (e.g., property purchase, trade evaluation) and use simpler logic for the rest. Allocate additional time specifically for AI tuning sprints.",_x000D_

RISK-TECH-003,Technical,"The data persistence and migration systems are fragile. A bug in the serialization, checksum, or migration logic could lead to widespread, unrecoverable loss of player save files and statistics.",3,5,15,High,"WI-006, WI-007, WI-008","Saving/loading complex object graphs (GameState) is prone to errors, and atomic file operations for migration are difficult to implement correctly, risking data corruption on failure.",_x000D_
1.  **Comprehensive Unit Testing**: Write extensive unit tests for the serialization/deserialization of the GameState and for the checksum logic._x000D_
2.  **Transactional Operations**: Ensure all database updates are wrapped in transactions. For file migration, implement a 'backup-migrate-replace-delete backup' sequence within a try/catch block to ensure atomicity._x000D_
3.  **Versioned Schema**: Maintain a strict, documented schema for both the JSON save file and the SQLite database for each version. ,"If the custom migration system proves too unreliable, disable automatic migration for a release. Instead, the game will mark old saves as 'incompatible' and rely on the user starting a new profile. This is a negative user experience but prevents data loss.",_x000D_
-   Integration tests for the save/load cycle fail intermittently._x000D_
-   A test of the migration path with a sample old save file results in a corrupted file. ,Data Engineer,2025-03-31,Identified

2.  **Prioritize MVP**: Aggressively prioritize the critical path for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Defer non-essential polish features (e.g., one of the two themes, advanced AI strategies) to a later release if necessary._x000D_
3.  **Frequent Velocity Tracking**: Monitor team velocity weekly to quickly identify estimation inaccuracies and adjust the project plan accordingly. ,"If a critical path task is projected to be more than 20% over budget, immediately hold a re-planning session. Descope non-essential features (e.g., reduce the number of stats tracked, simplify the tutorial) to protect the core release date.",_x000D_
-   After two sprints, the completed story points are less than 75% of the planned points._x000D_

The Rule Engine may be implemented without accounting for all of them, leading to bugs that break game authenticity and fairness.",3,4,12,Medium,"WI-013, WI-014, WI-015, WI-033","Misinterpretation of the written rulebook or failure to consider complex interactions between rules (e.g., bankruptcy during an auction for a building).",_x000D_
1.  **Rule-by-Rule TDD**: Implement the Rule Engine using Test-Driven Development (TDD). For each rule, write a failing test that represents it, then write the code to make it pass._x000D_
2.  **Peer Review of Logic**: Mandate that all code committed to the Rule Engine be peer-reviewed by another developer with the official rulebook open as a reference._x000D_
3.  **Dedicated QA Scenarios**: QA team to create a specific test plan based on known tricky Monopoly scenarios (e.g., building shortages, transactions involving mortgaged properties in a trade). ,"Allocate a dedicated 'bug-fixing' sprint before release focused solely on addressing issues found in the Rule Engine. If major flaws are found late, release with a 'Known Issues' list and prioritize a patch.",_x000D_

RISK-TECH-004,Technical,"The dynamic theme-switching system, which requires loading and unloading entire sets of 3D models, textures, UI skins, and audio at runtime, could cause significant performance hitching, memory leaks, or crashes.",4,3,12,Medium,WI-023,"Failing to properly manage asset unloading in Unity can lead to duplicated assets in memory, increasing the memory footprint with each theme switch and eventually causing instability.",_x000D_
1.  **Use Addressables**: Implement the theme system using Unity's Addressable Asset System, which is designed for dynamic content management and helps manage memory by tracking asset references._x000D_
2.  **Performance Budget**: Define a strict performance budget for theme switching (e.g., must complete in <2 seconds, must not increase persistent memory usage)._x000D_
3.  **Memory Profiling**: Regularly profile the application in the Unity Editor while repeatedly switching themes to proactively identify memory leaks. ,"If runtime switching proves too unstable or performance-intensive, change the feature to require an application restart to apply a new theme. This simplifies memory management significantly at the cost of user convenience.",_x000D_

1.  **Single Source of Truth**: Strictly enforce that the Presentation Layer is read-only. All UI elements must update themselves based on events fired *after* a successful change to the `GameState` object, never before._x000D_
2.  **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use a centralized event bus for all state changes. The logic layer publishes an event (e.g., `PlayerCashUpdated`), and UI components subscribe to it to update their visuals._x000D_
3.  **State Reconciliation**: Implement a debug feature to force a full refresh of the UI from the current `GameState` to help diagnose and fix desync issues. ,"Implement a periodic (e.g., once per turn) state reconciliation check that compares the visual state to the logical state and logs any discrepancies.

Finding the right balance for 'Easy', 'Medium', and 'Hard' that satisfies players is a process of trial and error, not just coding.",_x000D_
1.  **Expose Parameters Clearly**: Ensure the `ai_config.json` is well-documented and easily editable by non-programmers (e.g., a game designer or QA)._x000D_
2.  **Develop Debug Tools**: Create in-game debug tools to visualize AI decision-making (e.g., text overlay showing why an AI made a certain trade offer)._x000D_
3.  **Schedule Specific Tuning Time**: Allocate dedicated time in the project schedule specifically for 'AI Playtesting and Tuning', separate from the initial implementation. ,"If tuning takes too long, launch with less distinct difficulty levels (e.g., 'Medium' and 'Hard' are very similar). Clearly label them and plan to improve the distinction in a post-launch patch based on player feedback.",_x000D_

2.  **Mandatory Documentation**: Require that the architecture and public APIs of these core systems be thoroughly documented as they are built, not after the fact._x000D_
3.  **Code Reviews**: Ensure all check-ins to these systems are reviewed by at least one other team member to spread knowledge. ,"If a key person becomes unavailable, the project schedule must be paused and re-evaluated. Allocate an emergency budget for hiring an external contractor with relevant expertise or for extensive ramp-up time for an existing team member.",_x000D_

Native code crashes or exceptions on non-main threads can bypass standard C# exception handlers.",_x000D_
1.  **Layered Handling**: Implement multiple layers of exception handling: C#'s `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException`, Unity's `Application.logMessageReceivedThreaded`, and standard try-catch blocks in entry points for async operations._x000D_
2.  **Robust Handler Logic**: Keep the handler itself extremely simple and dependency-free. It should not use complex game systems; its only job is to log to a pre-configured, static logger and display a pre-instantiated UI element._x000D_
3.  **Log Flushing**: Ensure the logger is configured to flush messages to disk immediately on ERROR level to prevent log loss if the application terminates abruptly. ,"If the handler proves unreliable, supplement it with an external crash reporting service (e.g., Unity Crash and Exception Reporting, Sentry). This would violate the 'no network connectivity' constraint but could be a necessary tool for post-launch support.",_x000D_

1.  **Continuous Profiling**: Integrate regular performance profiling into the development cycle. Define a specific test scenario on a machine that matches the 'Recommended' hardware spec to use as a benchmark._x000D_
2.  **Asset Budgets**: Define and enforce budgets for assets (e.g., polygon counts for models, texture resolutions, audio compression) to prevent performance degradation from overly complex art._x000D_
3.  **Code Optimization Reviews**: Specifically review code for performance anti-patterns, such as frequent memory allocations in `Update()` loops which can cause garbage collection spikes. ,"If performance targets are not being met late in the project, create a dedicated 'optimization sprint'. This involves de-scoping new features to focus on profiling and fixing the worst-offending systems.
