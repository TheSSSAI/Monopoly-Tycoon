## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-063

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

AI behavior parameters must be stored in an external, human-readable JSON file to allow for tuning without recompiling the application.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- The system must successfully load AI parameters from a specified JSON file at runtime.
- Changes to the external JSON file must be reflected in AI behavior upon application restart.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- Requires a service capable of reading a file from disk.
- Requires a JSON deserialization mechanism to convert the file content into strongly-typed C# objects.
- The file path for the AI configuration must be configurable or provided by the consuming service.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement is a primary driver for the repository's existence. The repository description explicitly states its use is to load the JSON file containing AI behavior parameters, directly fulfilling this need.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-084

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

All user-facing text must be stored in external resource files to support localization.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- The application must load all UI text from an external source.
- The system must be capable of loading different resource files based on a selected language.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- Requires a generic file loading service that can handle localization files (e.g., JSON files containing key-value pairs).
- The service must be reusable for different types of configuration, including localization strings.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement demonstrates the repository's reusability, as its description explicitly mentions its use for loading localization strings.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-083

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The in-game rulebook content must be loaded from an external source.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- The rulebook display must populate its content from an external file at runtime.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- Requires the configuration loading service to be generic enough to handle a potentially large text or structured content file for the rulebook.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

The repository's description confirms its role in loading rulebook content, showcasing its utility as a generic configuration loader.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

- {'component_name': 'JsonConfigurationProvider', 'component_specification': 'A concrete implementation of the IConfigurationProvider interface that is responsible for asynchronously loading a specified JSON file from the file system and deserializing it into a strongly-typed C# object.', 'implementation_requirements': ['Must implement the IConfigurationProvider interface defined in REPO-AA-004.', 'Must use asynchronous file I/O to prevent blocking application threads.', 'Must use System.Text.Json for deserialization.', 'Must gracefully handle and log errors such as file not found or invalid JSON format, wrapping them in a custom ConfigurationException before re-throwing.'], 'architectural_context': 'Belongs to the Infrastructure Layer. This component abstracts file system access and data format parsing from the application and business logic layers.', 'extraction_reasoning': "This is the core component of this repository, encapsulating all the logic for fulfilling the repository's primary responsibility of loading configuration files."}

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Infrastructure Layer', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Provides technical capabilities, including data persistence, logging, and interaction with external systems like the file system. It implements interfaces defined in the application abstractions.', 'layer_constraints': ['Must not contain any business logic or game rules.', 'Should depend only on abstractions, not on other concrete layers like Presentation or Business Logic.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Repository Pattern (as a Provider)', 'Dependency Injection'], 'extraction_reasoning': "This repository is explicitly mapped to the Infrastructure Layer, and its responsibilities directly align with the layer's purpose of handling external file loading and configuration."}

## 1.5.0.0 Dependency Interfaces

### 1.5.1.0 Interface Name

#### 1.5.1.1 Interface Name

ILogger

#### 1.5.1.2 Source Repository

REPO-AA-004

#### 1.5.1.3 Method Contracts

- {'method_name': 'Error', 'method_signature': 'void Error(Exception ex, string messageTemplate, params object[] propertyValues)', 'method_purpose': 'To log exceptions that occur during file access or JSON deserialization, providing diagnostic information for developers.', 'integration_context': 'Called within a catch block when file I/O or JsonSerializer.Deserialize fails, before wrapping the exception in a ConfigurationException.'}

#### 1.5.1.4 Integration Pattern

Dependency Injection

#### 1.5.1.5 Communication Protocol

In-Process Method Call

#### 1.5.1.6 Extraction Reasoning

The repository's error handling specification requires robust, structured logging. This necessitates a dependency on the application's common logging abstraction (ILogger) to remain decoupled from a specific logging implementation like Serilog (REPO-IL-006).

### 1.5.2.0 Interface Name

#### 1.5.2.1 Interface Name

IConfigurationProvider

#### 1.5.2.2 Source Repository

REPO-AA-004

#### 1.5.2.3 Method Contracts

*No items available*

#### 1.5.2.4 Integration Pattern

Interface Implementation

#### 1.5.2.5 Communication Protocol

N/A

#### 1.5.2.6 Extraction Reasoning

This repository's primary function is to provide the concrete implementation of the IConfigurationProvider interface, fulfilling the contract defined in the Application Abstractions layer. This is the core of its adherence to the Dependency Inversion Principle.

## 1.6.0.0 Exposed Interfaces

- {'interface_name': 'IConfigurationProvider', 'consumer_repositories': ['REPO-AS-005', 'REPO-PU-010'], 'method_contracts': [{'method_name': 'LoadAsync<T>', 'method_signature': 'Task<T?> LoadAsync<T>(string configPath) where T : class', 'method_purpose': 'Asynchronously loads and deserializes a JSON configuration file from the specified path into a strongly-typed object of the generic type T.', 'implementation_requirements': 'The implementation must be asynchronous, handle file I/O and deserialization exceptions by logging them, and then wrap them in a custom ConfigurationException to be thrown to the caller.'}], 'service_level_requirements': ['File I/O must be non-blocking to prevent impacting application startup time or UI responsiveness.', 'Error handling must be robust, providing clear exceptions for failures without crashing the application.'], 'implementation_constraints': ['The consuming service must provide the file path; no hardcoded paths are allowed within this repository.', 'The generic type T must be a reference type and be deserializable from the target JSON file.'], 'extraction_reasoning': 'This repository provides the concrete implementation of the IConfigurationProvider interface. This contract is exposed to consumers like the Application Services Layer (REPO-AS-005) for loading AI parameters and the Presentation Layer (REPO-PU-010) for loading rulebook or localization data, enabling a decoupled and maintainable architecture.'}

## 1.7.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0 Framework Requirements

.NET 8 with C#.

### 1.7.2.0 Integration Technologies

- System.Text.Json

### 1.7.3.0 Performance Constraints

Configuration loading, especially at startup, must use async file I/O to avoid blocking the main application thread, contributing to fast load times (REQ-1-015).

### 1.7.4.0 Security Requirements

N/A for this component, as it only reads local configuration files and does not handle sensitive user data or network communication.
