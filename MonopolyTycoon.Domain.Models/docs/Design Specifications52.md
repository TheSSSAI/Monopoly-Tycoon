# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Defines the Plain Old C# Object (POCO) data models that form the canonical representation of the entire game state, including entities, value objects, and aggregates.
- Acts as a foundational, dependency-free contract library, providing shared data structures (including DTOs) for all other layers and components in the solution.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- .NET 8 Class Library
- C# 12

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must have zero dependencies on other project-specific code to prevent circular references and ensure maximum reusability.
- Models must be persistence-agnostic, containing no attributes or logic related to specific database technologies (e.g., ORM mapping attributes).
- Models intended for serialization must be compatible with System.Text.Json.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

- {'dependency_type': 'Consumed By', 'target_component': 'All Other Layers (Presentation, Application Services, Business Logic, Infrastructure)', 'integration_pattern': 'Project Reference / NuGet Package', 'reasoning': "This repository provides the core data contracts (the 'language') used for all inter-layer communication and state management. Every other component needs to reference these models to understand and operate on the application's data."}

### 2.1.5 Analysis Insights

This repository is the cornerstone of the solution's architecture, enforcing a common data language that decouples all other layers. Its primary constraint is its dependency-free nature, which is critical for maintaining a clean, layered architecture. Implementation should prioritize immutability using C# records and 'init' setters to enhance predictability and thread safety.

# 3.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-041

#### 3.1.1.2 Requirement Description

The system must be able to represent the complete state of a game in a single, self-contained data structure.

#### 3.1.1.3 Implementation Implications

- A root aggregate model, 'GameState', must be created.
- This model will contain collections and nested objects representing all facets of the game (players, board, bank, decks).

#### 3.1.1.4 Required Components

- GameState.cs
- PlayerState.cs
- BoardState.cs
- BankState.cs
- DeckState.cs

#### 3.1.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement directly mandates the creation of the primary aggregate root model ('GameState') which serves as the container for all other game-related state, aligning with the 'Game State Save File Structure' design.

### 3.1.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-031

#### 3.1.2.2 Requirement Description

The system must maintain the state of each player, including their current board position, cash on hand, owned properties, and get-out-of-jail-free cards.

#### 3.1.2.3 Implementation Implications

- A 'PlayerState' model must be created with properties for position, cash, property ownership, and special cards.
- This model will be part of a collection within the main 'GameState' model.

#### 3.1.2.4 Required Components

- PlayerState.cs

#### 3.1.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement defines the necessary properties for the 'PlayerState' entity, which is a critical component of the overall 'GameState' as specified in REQ-1-041.

## 3.2.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1 Requirement Type

Data Persistence

#### 3.2.1.2 Requirement Specification

The complete game state must be serialized to a single JSON file (REQ-1-087).

#### 3.2.1.3 Implementation Impact

All models under the 'GameState' aggregate must be designed for compatibility with 'System.Text.Json' serialization. Using C# 'record' types is highly recommended.

#### 3.2.1.4 Design Constraints

- Models must have public properties for serialization.
- Object graphs must not contain circular references that the serializer cannot handle.

#### 3.2.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

The choice of JSON serialization directly influences the design of the data models, favoring simple data structures and immutability which 'record' types provide natively.

### 3.2.2.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1 Requirement Type

Data Versioning

#### 3.2.2.2 Requirement Specification

The system must include data migration logic to handle changes in the save file format between versions (REQ-1-090).

#### 3.2.2.3 Implementation Impact

The 'GameState' model must include a 'GameVersion' property (e.g., 'public string GameVersion { get; init; }').

#### 3.2.2.4 Design Constraints

- The version property must be present at the root of the serialized JSON object for easy access before full deserialization.

#### 3.2.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

This NFR mandates a specific field within the 'GameState' model to enable the version detection necessary for the data migration process outlined in sequence diagram ID 177.

## 3.3.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The requirements primarily define the structure of the 'GameState' and 'PlayerState' models. Non-functional requirements for persistence and data migration impose specific design constraints, such as ensuring JSON serialization compatibility and including a versioning field. This repository is foundational for fulfilling these requirements.

# 4.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1 Pattern Name

Layered Architecture

#### 4.1.1.2 Pattern Application

This repository serves as a cross-cutting, foundational 'Contracts' or 'Shared Kernel' library. It provides the data models used by all layers (Presentation, Application Services, Business Logic, Infrastructure) without depending on any of them.

#### 4.1.1.3 Required Components

- All model classes (e.g., GameState.cs, PlayerProfile.cs)

#### 4.1.1.4 Implementation Strategy

The project will be a standalone .NET 8 Class Library. All other projects in the solution will have a project reference to this one. It will contain no business logic, only data definitions.

#### 4.1.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

The description explicitly states this repository's role is to decouple components by providing a common set of objects, which is a textbook application of a shared model library in a layered architecture.

### 4.1.2.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1 Pattern Name

Model-View-Controller (MVC)

#### 4.1.2.2 Pattern Application

The classes and records within this repository constitute the 'Model' component of the MVC pattern. They represent the application's state and are manipulated by the 'Controller' (Application Services/Business Logic) and rendered by the 'View' (Presentation Layer).

#### 4.1.2.3 Required Components

- All model classes

#### 4.1.2.4 Implementation Strategy

Models will be implemented as POCOs with properties and state, but no behavior related to UI or input handling, ensuring a clean separation from the View and Controller.

#### 4.1.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

The architectural description identifies MVC as a key pattern. This repository's sole purpose is to define the data models, which is the 'M' in MVC.

## 4.2.0.0 Integration Points

- {'integration_type': 'Data Contract', 'target_components': ['MonopolyTycoon.Application.Services', 'MonopolyTycoon.Domain.Logic', 'MonopolyTycoon.Infrastructure.Repositories', 'MonopolyTycoon.Presentation.Unity'], 'communication_pattern': 'In-Memory Object Reference', 'interface_requirements': ['Public classes/records with well-defined public properties.', "Adherence to non-nullable contracts via '#nullable enable'."], 'analysis_reasoning': "This repository's public types form the API contracts for all data passed between layers. Its integration is achieved through direct compile-time references to its types."}

# 5.0.0.0 Database Analysis

## 5.1.0.0 Entity Mappings

### 5.1.1.0 Entity Name

#### 5.1.1.1 Entity Name

GameState

#### 5.1.1.2 Database Table

GameState JSON File (e.g., save_slot_1.json)

#### 5.1.1.3 Required Properties

- gameStateId: Guid
- gameVersion: string
- playerStates: Array<PlayerState>
- boardState: object
- bankState: object

#### 5.1.1.5 Access Patterns

- Full document serialization for saving.
- Full document deserialization for loading.

#### 5.1.1.6 Analysis Reasoning

The 'Game State Save File Structure' diagram defines a document-based persistence model. The 'GameState' C# model will be a direct 1:1 representation of this JSON structure to facilitate simple and efficient serialization.

### 5.1.2.0 Entity Name

#### 5.1.2.1 Entity Name

PlayerProfile

#### 5.1.2.2 Database Table

PlayerProfile

#### 5.1.2.3 Required Properties

- profileId: Guid
- displayName: string
- createdAt: DateTime
- updatedAt: DateTime

#### 5.1.2.4 Relationship Mappings

- Has a one-to-one relationship with PlayerStatistic.
- Has one-to-many relationships with GameResult and SavedGame.

#### 5.1.2.5 Access Patterns

- CRUD operations via repository methods (e.g., GetById, GetByName, Create, Update).

#### 5.1.2.6 Analysis Reasoning

The 'Monopoly Tycoon Player Data ERD' specifies a relational schema for player data. This repository must define the corresponding 'PlayerProfile' POCO, which the Infrastructure layer will use for mapping data to and from the SQLite database.

### 5.1.3.0 Entity Name

#### 5.1.3.1 Entity Name

GameResult

#### 5.1.3.2 Database Table

GameResult

#### 5.1.3.3 Required Properties

- didHumanWin: bool
- gameDurationSeconds: int
- endTimestamp: DateTime

#### 5.1.3.4 Relationship Mappings

- Belongs to one PlayerProfile.
- Has one-to-many GameParticipants.

#### 5.1.3.5 Access Patterns

- Create (INSERT) on game completion.
- Read (SELECT) for displaying game history.

#### 5.1.3.6 Analysis Reasoning

As per the ERD, a 'GameResult' model is needed to represent a completed game's outcome. This model will be populated by the Application Services layer and persisted by the Infrastructure layer.

## 5.2.0.0 Data Access Requirements

### 5.2.1.0 Operation Type

#### 5.2.1.1 Operation Type

Serialization / Deserialization

#### 5.2.1.2 Required Methods

#### 5.2.1.3 Performance Constraints

Serialization and deserialization must be fast enough to meet the <10 second game load time specified in REQ-1-015.

#### 5.2.1.4 Analysis Reasoning

The models, particularly 'GameState', are designed to be serialized. Their structure directly supports the data access pattern for saving and loading games.

### 5.2.2.0 Operation Type

#### 5.2.2.1 Operation Type

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

#### 5.2.2.2 Required Methods

- N/A (Handled by repository implementation)

#### 5.2.2.3 Performance Constraints

Models should be simple POCOs to allow for efficient mapping from database query results by a lightweight tool like Dapper or EF Core.

#### 5.2.2.4 Analysis Reasoning

The relational models ('PlayerProfile', etc.) are designed to be cleanly mapped from the SQLite database tables by the repositories in the Infrastructure layer.

Provides the 'GameState' data contract.

#### 6.1.1.3 Required Interfaces

- GameState

#### 6.1.1.4 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'ApplicationService.GetCurrentGameState()', 'interaction_context': 'Called by the Application Service to retrieve the current state before passing it to the repository for saving.', 'parameter_analysis': 'N/A', 'return_type_analysis': "Returns a 'GameState' object, which is defined in this repository.", 'analysis_reasoning': "The 'GameState' model is the central payload for the save game sequence, acting as the data container passed from the domain to the infrastructure layer."}

#### 6.1.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This sequence demonstrates the critical role of the 'GameState' model as the unit of persistence for a game session.

### 6.1.2.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.2.1 Sequence Name

Update Player Statistics (ID 175)

#### 6.1.2.2 Repository Role

Provides the 'GameResult' DTO contract.

#### 6.1.2.3 Required Interfaces

- GameResult

#### 6.1.2.4 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'StatisticsRepository.UpdatePlayerStatisticsAsync(gameResult)', 'interaction_context': 'Called by the Application Service to persist the results of a completed game.', 'parameter_analysis': "Accepts a 'GameResult' object, defined in this repository, which contains aggregated results like winner, duration, etc.", 'return_type_analysis': 'Returns a Task.', 'analysis_reasoning': "A 'GameResult' DTO is necessary to transfer the outcome of a game from the domain to the persistence layer in a structured way. This model's definition belongs in this repository."}

#### 6.1.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

This sequence shows the need for DTOs to communicate specific, bounded contexts of data (like the result of a single game) between layers.

## 6.2.0.0 Communication Protocols

- {'protocol_type': 'N/A', 'implementation_requirements': 'This repository does not implement communication protocols; it defines the data payloads used in communications between other components.', 'analysis_reasoning': 'The role of this repository is strictly data definition, not communication or logic implementation.'}

# 7.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

*No items available*

# 8.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis synthesized information from all provided artifacts. Repository description and requirements REQ-1-031/REQ-1-041 defined the scope. Architecture document defined its place as a foundational layer and the patterns it must adhere to. Database designs provided the schema for both document ('GameState') and relational ('PlayerProfile') models. Sequence diagrams revealed the specific models and DTOs needed as payloads for inter-layer communication.

## 8.2.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision: Define models for both document and relational persistence in this single repository. Reason: The repository's scope is all shared data contracts for the solution.
- Decision: Mandate the use of C# 'record' types and 'init' setters. Reason: Aligns with the tech guide for .NET 8, promoting immutability and simplifying implementation.
- Decision: Identify the need for DTOs (e.g., 'GameResult', 'TradeProposal') not explicitly listed in requirements. Reason: Sequence diagrams clearly show these data structures being passed between layers, making them necessary shared contracts.

## 8.3.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption: 'POCO' implies models are free of logic. Verified: The architecture and repository descriptions confirm this separation of concerns.
- Assumption: Models must be JSON serializable. Verified: REQ-1-087 and the 'GameState' document design confirm this.
- Assumption: This repository is a dependency for all others. Verified: The Layered Architecture pattern and the repository's description as a 'contract library' validate this.

## 8.4.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Checked 'GameState' model structure against the 'Game State Save File Structure' ER diagram to ensure all fields are accounted for.
- Checked relational model properties (e.g., 'PlayerProfile') against the 'Monopoly Tycoon Player Data ERD' to ensure column-to-property alignment.
- Cross-referenced models identified in sequence diagrams ('GameState', 'GameResult') with those derived from requirements and database designs to ensure a consistent and complete set of required types.
