## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-041

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system shall define and manage a comprehensive game state object that encapsulates all information required to save, load, and render a game session. This includes, but is not limited to, the state of all players, the game board, the bank, and card decks.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- The existence of a 'GameState' data structure.
- The 'GameState' structure must contain fields for player states, board state, bank state, deck states, and game metadata.
- The 'GameState' structure must be serializable to a persistent format (e.g., JSON).

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- A central 'GameState' class must be created in the domain model.
- This class will be the root object for game save files, as detailed in the 'Game State Save File Structure' design.
- All services that modify the state of the game must operate on an instance of this 'GameState' object.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement directly mandates the creation of the 'GameState' model, which is a primary responsibility of the MonopolyTycoon.Domain.Models repository. The repository's purpose is to provide the canonical, data-only representation of this state.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-031

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system shall maintain a detailed state for each player, including their identity, current cash balance, owned properties, and other relevant attributes.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- The existence of a 'PlayerState' data structure.
- The 'PlayerState' structure must contain fields for player ID, name, cash, and a list of owned assets.
- The system must be able to track the state for multiple players simultaneously.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- A 'PlayerState' class must be created in the domain model.
- The 'GameState' object will contain a collection of these 'PlayerState' objects.
- This model will be used by the UI to render player-specific information and by the rule engine to validate player actions.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement directly mandates the creation of the 'PlayerState' model, another primary responsibility of this repository. This model serves as the data contract for all player-related information.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

### 1.3.1.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.1.1 Component Name

GameState

#### 1.3.1.2 Component Specification

A Plain Old C# Object (POCO) that serves as the root entity for a game session. It aggregates all other state models (PlayerState, BoardState, BankState, etc.) into a single, serializable object. It represents the canonical data structure for a game in progress.

#### 1.3.1.3 Implementation Requirements

- Must be a public class or record.
- Must contain public properties for all constituent state objects (PlayerStates, BoardState, BankState, etc.).
- Must be serializable using System.Text.Json.
- Must not contain any business logic, validation, or methods with side effects.

#### 1.3.1.4 Architectural Context

Business Logic (Domain) Layer. This model is the central data entity of the domain.

#### 1.3.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is one of the two core models explicitly defined in the repository's 'architecture_map'. Its creation is the primary fulfillment of REQ-1-041 and the central purpose of this repository.

### 1.3.2.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.2.1 Component Name

PlayerState

#### 1.3.2.2 Component Specification

A POCO representing the complete state of a single player in the game. This includes their identity, cash, assets, and current status (e.g., in jail).

#### 1.3.2.3 Implementation Requirements

- Must be a public class or record.
- Must contain public properties for player-specific data such as PlayerId, PlayerName, IsHuman, and Cash.
- Must be serializable.
- Must not contain any business logic or validation rules.

#### 1.3.2.4 Architectural Context

Business Logic (Domain) Layer. This model is a core entity aggregated by the GameState.

#### 1.3.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is the second core model explicitly defined in the repository's 'architecture_map'. Its creation fulfills REQ-1-031 and is a foundational responsibility of this repository.

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Business Logic (Domain) Layer', 'layer_responsibilities': "This repository contributes to the Business Logic Layer by defining its core, passive data models. It encapsulates the 'state' part of the domain, while other repositories will handle the 'behavior' (rules and logic).", 'layer_constraints': ['The models within this repository must be independent of UI, data storage, and other external concerns.', 'The models must not contain business rules; they are pure data containers.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Domain Model Pattern (Data aspect only)', 'Data Transfer Object (DTO)', 'Shared Kernel'], 'extraction_reasoning': "The repository is explicitly mapped to the 'business_logic_layer'. Its role as a dependency-free model library makes it a foundational component of this layer, providing the data contracts upon which all business rules operate."}

## 1.6.0.0 Exposed Interfaces

### 1.6.1.0 Interface Name

#### 1.6.1.1 Interface Name

GameState (Class)

#### 1.6.1.2 Consumer Repositories

- REPO-DR-002
- REPO-DA-003
- REPO-AS-005
- REPO-IP-SG-008
- REPO-IP-ST-009
- REPO-PU-010

#### 1.6.1.3 Method Contracts

#### 1.6.1.4 Service Level Requirements

- Must be efficiently serializable to and from JSON format to meet the <10 second game load time (REQ-1-015).

#### 1.6.1.5 Implementation Constraints

- Must remain a pure POCO with no business logic.
- Changes to its structure may require a data migration strategy for saved games (as per REQ-1-090).

#### 1.6.1.6 Extraction Reasoning

This class is the primary exposed contract of the repository. It serves as the central data object for the entire application, consumed by the rule engine, AI, application services, persistence layers, and the UI, as validated by numerous sequence diagrams and the architecture definition.

### 1.6.2.0 Interface Name

#### 1.6.2.1 Interface Name

PlayerState (Class)

#### 1.6.2.2 Consumer Repositories

- REPO-DR-002
- REPO-DA-003
- REPO-AS-005
- REPO-PU-010

#### 1.6.2.3 Method Contracts

*No items available*

#### 1.6.2.4 Service Level Requirements

- Must be efficiently serializable as part of the parent GameState object.

#### 1.6.2.5 Implementation Constraints

- Must remain a pure POCO with no business logic.

#### 1.6.2.6 Extraction Reasoning

This class is a core data model exposed by the repository and is a fundamental building block of the GameState. It is directly consumed by any component that needs to read or reason about an individual player's status.

## 1.7.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0 Framework Requirements

The repository must be implemented as a .NET 8 Class Library, ensuring compatibility with the rest of the solution's .NET 8 technology stack.

### 1.7.2.0 Integration Technologies

- System.Text.Json: Models must be designed for efficient serialization with this library, using public properties with getters and setters/initters.

### 1.7.3.0 Performance Constraints

N/A - As a model library, it has no inherent performance constraints, but its design must support efficient serialization by consumer repositories to meet system-wide NFRs like REQ-1-015.

### 1.7.4.0 Security Requirements

N/A - The repository contains no active logic and handles no sensitive data, so it has no specific security requirements beyond standard code practices.
