## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-087

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The entire game state must be serialized into a single, versioned JSON file for persistence.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- A saved game file is created and contains all necessary game state information in a valid JSON format.
- The JSON file contains a 'gameVersion' property corresponding to the application version that created it.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The repository must use a robust JSON serialization library, specified as System.Text.Json.
- The GameState domain object must be fully serializable.
- The repository is responsible for embedding the current application version into the JSON output during the save process.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a primary functional requirement for this repository, defining the core data format and persistence strategy it must implement.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-088

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system must use a checksum or hash to validate the integrity of save files upon loading to detect corruption or tampering.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- A checksum is generated and stored alongside the save file data.
- Upon loading, the checksum of the file content is re-calculated and compared against the stored value.
- If checksums do not match, the file is considered corrupt and is not loaded, and the user is gracefully notified.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- A specific hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA256) must be used consistently for both generation and validation.
- The repository must handle checksum validation failures by throwing a specific, typed exception (e.g., SaveFileCorruptedException) for the Application Layer to catch.
- The checksum should be stored separately from the main JSON data to prevent it from affecting its own calculation.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a critical reliability requirement that this repository is solely responsible for implementing to ensure data integrity.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-090

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system must provide a data migration path for save files created with previous versions of the application.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- The system successfully loads a save file created by a supported older version.
- After loading and re-saving, the old save file is updated to the current version format.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The repository must read the 'gameVersion' property from the save file before full deserialization.
- If the version is old, the repository must delegate the raw file content to a dedicated DataMigrationManager component.
- The DataMigrationManager will perform the necessary transformations on the JSON data before it is passed back for deserialization.
- The migration process must be atomic to prevent data loss if it fails.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement ensures forward compatibility and user data preservation, and its technical implementation is a core responsibility of this repository.

### 1.2.4.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.4.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-015

#### 1.2.4.2 Requirement Text

Load a game from the main menu in under 10 seconds on recommended specs with an SSD.

#### 1.2.4.3 Validation Criteria

- The time from user action to playable game state must not exceed 10 seconds.

#### 1.2.4.4 Implementation Implications

- All file I/O operations within this repository must be fully asynchronous to avoid blocking the main application thread.
- Serialization and checksum calculation logic must be highly performant.

#### 1.2.4.5 Extraction Reasoning

This repository's load operation is a major contributor to the overall game load time, making this performance NFR a critical design constraint.
