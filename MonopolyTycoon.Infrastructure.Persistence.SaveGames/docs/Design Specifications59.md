# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary: Implements the full lifecycle of game state persistence, including serialization to JSON, asynchronous file system writes, checksum calculation/validation for integrity, and deserialization upon loading.
- Secondary: Responsible for detecting save file version mismatches and coordinating with a dedicated data migration service to ensure backward compatibility. It also provides metadata for all save slots for UI population.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- .NET 8, C#
- System.Text.Json for serialization/deserialization, and the native File System API (System.IO) for persistence.

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must operate exclusively within the Infrastructure Layer, with no dependencies on the Business Logic or Presentation layers, strictly adhering to the Layered Architecture principles.
- Implementation must be entirely asynchronous (using async/await) for all I/O operations to meet performance requirement REQ-1-015 and not block the main application thread.

# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-087

#### 3.1.1.2.0 Requirement Description

The game state must be saved as a single, versioned JSON file.

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The 'SaveAsync' method must use 'System.Text.Json.JsonSerializer' to serialize the 'GameState' domain object.
- The save file structure must include a top-level 'gameVersion' property, read from the 'GameState' object, to satisfy versioning requirements for migration.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- GameSaveRepository

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the core functional requirement defining the repository's primary output format and persistence medium.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-088

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

The system must validate save files using a checksum/hash to detect corruption.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- On save, a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA256) of the serialized JSON data must be computed and stored within the save file itself, likely in a wrapper object.
- On load, the hash must be re-computed from the data and compared against the stored value before deserialization. A mismatch signifies corruption.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- GameSaveRepository

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement dictates the data integrity validation logic. The implementation is detailed in sequence diagrams 185 and 194, confirming this repository's ownership of the process.

### 3.1.3.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-090

#### 3.1.3.2.0 Requirement Description

The system must support backward compatibility for save files... by implementing an automated, in-place data migration process.

#### 3.1.3.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The 'LoadAsync' method must first inspect the 'gameVersion' property of the raw save file.
- If the version is determined to be a legacy version, the repository must invoke a separate, injected 'IDataMigrationManager' service before proceeding with deserialization.

#### 3.1.3.4.0 Required Components

- GameSaveRepository

#### 3.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement establishes the repository's role as the trigger for the data migration workflow, as explicitly shown in sequence diagram 177.

### 3.1.4.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.4.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-085

#### 3.1.4.2.0 Requirement Description

The system must prevent the user from saving the game during specific, non-idle states.

#### 3.1.4.3.0 Implementation Implications

- This repository has no direct implementation for this requirement.
- The enforcement logic resides in the Presentation and/or Application Services layers, which will prevent the call to 'ISaveGameRepository.SaveAsync' from ever being made.

#### 3.1.4.4.0 Required Components

- PresentationLayer.UIController
- ApplicationService.GameSessionService

#### 3.1.4.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Analysis of the architecture confirms that business rule enforcement like this is a responsibility of higher layers, not the persistence infrastructure. The repository's contract is to save when instructed.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

Load a game from the main menu in under 10 seconds on recommended specs with an SSD (REQ-1-015).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

All file I/O operations within the repository must be fully asynchronous to avoid blocking the UI thread. Serialization and checksum calculations must be performant, favoring stream-based APIs.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Must use 'async'/'await' for all methods involving file access.
- Must use 'System.Text.Json' for its high performance characteristics over older serializers.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This repository is a major component in the game loading sequence (diagram 188), and its performance is critical to meeting this NFR.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Reliability

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

Implement checksum/hash validation for save files to detect corruption (REQ-1-088).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The save process must be atomic to prevent creating corrupted files. The standard pattern is to write to a temporary file, and only upon successful completion, move/rename it to the final destination file.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- The 'SaveAsync' method must implement an atomic write strategy.
- The 'LoadAsync' method must throw a specific exception on checksum mismatch that can be gracefully handled by the application layer.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Reliability is paramount for user data. Checksum validation and atomic writes are standard industry tactics to fulfill this requirement.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The repository is directly responsible for implementing the core persistence requirements (REQ-1-087, REQ-1-088, REQ-1-090). It is a critical component for ensuring data integrity, backward compatibility, and performance. Its responsibilities are well-defined and isolated from business rule enforcement.

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

Implementation Risk

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

The requirement for atomic write operations during the save process is critical for reliability but is not explicitly detailed in any sequence diagram. A naive 'write-over' implementation could easily lead to data corruption if the application closes or crashes mid-write.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

The 'SaveAsync' method MUST be implemented using a 'write-to-temp-then-rename' strategy to ensure atomicity. This adds minor complexity but is non-negotiable for data safety.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Failure to ensure atomic writes is a common and severe defect in file-based persistence systems, directly impacting user data reliability.

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Dependency Contract

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

The repository depends on a 'data migration service' (per REQ-1-090 and sequence 177), but the interface for this service ('IDataMigrationManager') is not explicitly defined in the provided context. A clear contract is needed.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

The development of this repository requires a formal definition of the 'IDataMigrationManager' interface, including its methods, parameters (raw data, source version), and return types (migrated raw data), to be defined in the 'Application.Abstractions' layer.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

The repository cannot be fully implemented or tested without a concrete interface contract for this critical dependency.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by systematically processing the repository's description, requirements map (REQ-1-085, REQ-1-087, REQ-1-088, REQ-1-090), architectural context (Layered, Repository Pattern), and relevant sequence diagrams (177, 185, 187, 188, 194). The database ERD for 'GameState' was used to understand the object structure being persisted.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Determined repository scope based on its explicit description and functional requirements.
- Deduced interface contracts ('ISaveGameRepository', 'IDataMigrationManager') from sequence diagrams and architectural patterns.
- Identified atomic writes as a critical, implicit reliability requirement by cross-referencing with best practices for file persistence.
- Confirmed the repository's role is isolated to persistence, with business rule enforcement (REQ-1-085) happening in higher layers.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumed 'System.Text.Json' is the chosen serializer based on the technology stack specification.
- Assumed the 'data migration service' will be exposed via a dependency-injectable interface, consistent with the specified architectural patterns.
- Verified that the repository's responsibilities align perfectly with the 'Infrastructure Layer' definition in the architecture document.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Sequence diagram 187 (Save) was checked against REQ-1-087 (JSON format).
- Sequence diagrams 185 and 194 (Corruption Detection) were checked against REQ-1-088 (Checksum).
- Sequence diagram 177 (Migration) was checked against REQ-1-090 (Backward Compatibility).
- The 'GameState' ERD ('id:32') was used to validate the payload that must be serialized/deserialized.
