"Implement Database Backup Service","Create a `DatabaseBackupService.cs`. This service will run at application startup. It will check the last modified timestamp of the main database file against a stored timestamp. If the file is newer, it will copy the file to a backup location (e.g., `MonopolyTycoon.db.bak1`).
