It validates the entire bankruptcy flow, from debt trigger to asset transfer. Uses the curated save file.","Manually test bankruptcy. This is very time-consuming to set up and hard to repeat with the exact same conditions."

The unit tests must cover all logical branches and use mocks to isolate the logic from actual file or database I/O.","Write only integration tests for these systems. This makes it harder to pinpoint the exact location of a bug when a test fails."
US-010-T01,Develop Statistics Aggregation Service,Backend Development,Data Engineering,Medium,8.3,Mid,1,US-008-T04,TRUE,"This service translates the raw final game state into the specific metrics required for persistence. It requires careful calculation to be accurate.","Calculate all stats directly within the repository. A separate service provides better separation of concerns."
US-010-T02,"Implement Statistics Update in Repository",Backend Development,Data Engineering,High,10.5,Senior,1,"US-025-T01, US-010-T01",TRUE,"This involves a complex, transactional database write. It must be atomic to prevent data corruption. A senior developer should handle the SQL transaction logic.","Perform separate, non-transactional writes for each statistic. This is risky as a failure midway could leave the stats in an inconsistent state."
US-010-T03,"Create UI Screen to Display Statistics",Frontend Development,N/A,Low,8.0,Junior,1,US-010-T02,TRUE,"A simple, read-only UI screen. Good for a junior developer. The main work is formatting the data nicely for display.","Combine statistics with the main player profile screen. A dedicated screen is better for displaying the large amount of data."
US-015-T01,Create In-Game Pause Menu UI,Frontend Development,Design,Low,7.3,Junior,1,"",TRUE,"Standard UI task. The logic for pausing the game via `Time.timeScale` is straightforward.","Don't have a pause menu and require players to quit to the main menu to access settings. This is a very poor user experience."
US-015-T02,"Implement Volume Control Sliders",Frontend Development,N/A,Medium,8.3,Mid,1,US-015-T01,TRUE,"Requires knowledge of Unity's AudioMixer system and how to expose and control parameters from C# scripts.","Have a single master volume slider. Independent controls are a standard and expected feature."
US-015-T03,"Implement Game Speed Control Logic",Backend Development,Frontend Development,Medium,8.5,Mid,1,US-015-T01,TRUE,"This requires refactoring all timed actions (animations, delays) to respect a central `GameSpeedManager`. This can be an intrusive change if not planned for.","Hardcode all animation speeds. This fails to meet the requirement and removes a key quality-of-life feature for experienced players."

This is not user-friendly and is error-prone."
US-016-T01,"Create Victory and Game Over UI Prefabs",Frontend Development,Design,Medium,8.3,Mid,1,"",TRUE,"These are important screens for player feedback. They require good visual design and art assets to be effective.","Use a simple text message ('You Win!') on a black screen. This feels anticlimactic and unpolished."
US-016-T02,"Create Game Summary Screen UI",Frontend Development,Design,Medium,10.2,Mid,1,"",TRUE,"The flexible layout to handle 2-4 players adds complexity. Needs to be well-designed to be readable and not cluttered.","Show only the winner's stats. Displaying stats for all players provides better context and closure."

A senior developer is needed to manage this complex state transition.","Simply end the game when the player loses. The requirement to simulate the rest of the game adds significant complexity but provides a more complete summary."
US-025-T01,"Implement StatisticsRepository for Read/Write Operations",Backend Development,Data Engineering,High,14.7,Senior,1,US-024-T02,TRUE,"This is the data access backbone for all player progression. A senior developer must ensure all database operations are efficient, correct, and transactional.","Use a single large JSON file for all stats. This becomes very inefficient to read and write as the player's history grows."
US-026-T01,Implement Database Backup Service,Backend Development,DevOps,Medium,5.5,Mid,1,US-024-T01,TRUE,"This is a key data resilience feature. The logic for file timestamp checking and backup rotation needs to be robust.","Don't back up the database. This puts the player's entire historical progress at risk of corruption."

It requires a developer to go through the entire core codebase and add meaningful log statements at the correct levels.","Add logs only when debugging a specific issue. Proactive logging is much more effective for diagnosing issues in a released product."
US-027-T03,"Document Project Setup and Onboarding Process",Product Management,DevOps,Low,4.0,Mid,1,US-027-T02,TRUE,"Crucial for team scalability and maintainability. This should be done by someone with a clear understanding of the full development toolchain.","Let new developers figure out the setup on their own. This leads to wasted time and inconsistent development environments."
US-023-T01,Design Data Migration Architecture,Backend Development,Data Engineering,High,8.3,Lead,1,US-022-T01,TRUE,"This is a forward-looking architectural task. A lead or architect should design a scalable system for handling multiple versions of save data over the product's lifecycle.","Decide to break save compatibility with every major update.

US-017-T04,"Performance Profiling and Optimization Pass",Frontend Development,Quality Assurance,High,16.7,Senior,1,US-017-T03,TRUE,"A critical step to meet NFRs. Requires a specialist or a senior developer with strong profiling skills to identify and fix bottlenecks without degrading visual quality.","Ship the game without profiling and hope it runs well. This is a high-risk strategy that often leads to negative reviews due to poor performance."
US-020-T01,"Architect Theming System using ScriptableObjects",Frontend Development,Design,High,10.3,Lead,1,"",FALSE,"This is a major architectural task. A lead developer should design the system to be scalable and easy for artists to use. ScriptableObjects are a good fit.","Hardcode asset references for each theme in large switch statements. This is extremely brittle and hard to maintain."

It must handle dynamic asset loading and unloading, which can be tricky to get right without causing memory leaks.","Have each individual UI component be responsible for loading its own themed assets. This leads to a lot of duplicated logic."
US-020-T03,"Refactor UI and Game Objects to Use ThemeManager",Frontend Development,N/A,High,16.7,Mid,1,US-020-T02,FALSE,"This is a large, intrusive refactoring task. It requires touching almost every visual component in the game. Must be done carefully to avoid regressions.","Create a completely separate set of scenes and prefabs for each theme.
