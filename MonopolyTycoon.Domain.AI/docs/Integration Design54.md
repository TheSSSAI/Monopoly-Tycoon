## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-004

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

AI opponents must be available at three distinct difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- The application must allow the user to select one of three AI difficulty levels during game setup.
- The selected difficulty level must result in a noticeable difference in AI strategic behavior.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The AI logic must be parameterized to support different behaviors based on a difficulty setting.
- Configuration data for each difficulty level must be loaded and passed to the AI decision-making module.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement is a primary driver for the AI repository, mandating the core feature of variable difficulty, which influences the entire design of the AI's behavior and the parameters passed into its controller.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-060

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system's AI shall be capable of initiating, evaluating, and completing trades with other AI players.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- During its turn, an AI player must be able to identify and propose a valid trade to another player.
- An AI must be able to evaluate an incoming trade offer and decide whether to accept or decline.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The AI's behavior tree must include logic for evaluating assets, identifying potential trade partners, constructing trade offers, and proposing them.
- The AI needs to expose a method to the Application Services layer for evaluating trade offers initiated by other players.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement defines key strategic capabilities (proposing and evaluating trades) that must be implemented within the AI's decision-making logic and exposed through its interface contract.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-063

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The AI's decision-making logic must be implemented using a Behavior Tree architecture. AI behavior parameters (e.g., risk tolerance, building priority) must be stored in an external JSON file.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- The AI's decision-making code must use a recognizable Behavior Tree pattern or library.
- A JSON file containing AI parameters must exist and be loaded by the application at runtime to configure AI behavior.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The repository must include a dependency on a Behavior Tree framework.
- The AI controller must be designed to accept parameters from an external source, decoupling tuning from code changes.
- The Infrastructure Layer (REPO-IC-007) will be responsible for loading the JSON file, and the Application Layer (REPO-AS-005) will pass the resulting parameter object to this repository's controller.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a critical architectural requirement that dictates the specific implementation technology (Behavior Tree) and the integration pattern for configuration (receiving parameters via method calls).

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

- {'component_name': 'AIBehaviorTreeExecutor', 'component_specification': "This component is responsible for implementing the AI's decision-making logic using a Behavior Tree. It receives the current game state and AI parameters, processes them through the tree, and returns a single, proposed action for the AI to take. It is the concrete implementation of the IAIController interface.", 'implementation_requirements': ["Must use the 'Panda BT' third-party library or a similar framework.", 'Must implement the IAIController interface.', 'Must be a stateless service; all context is passed in via method calls.', "Must be robust and return a safe default action (e.g., 'EndTurn') in case of internal errors."], 'architectural_context': 'This component resides in the Business Logic (Domain) Layer. It encapsulates complex AI strategy, is independent of UI and data persistence, and is consumed by the Application Services Layer.', 'extraction_reasoning': "This repository's sole purpose is to contain and implement the AIBehaviorTreeExecutor component, as specified in the architecture and repository definition."}

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Business Logic (Domain) Layer', 'layer_responsibilities': 'This layer contains the core logic and rules of the game, including AI decision-making. It is independent of other layers like presentation or infrastructure.', 'layer_constraints': ['Must not contain any UI, data access, or direct user input handling logic.', 'Must not directly modify application state; it processes data and returns results or proposes state changes.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Behavior Tree', 'Strategy Pattern'], 'extraction_reasoning': 'The repository is explicitly mapped to the Business Logic Layer, as its responsibility is to implement AI strategy, which is a core domain concern.'}

## 1.5.0.0 Dependency Interfaces

### 1.5.1.0 Interface Name

#### 1.5.1.1 Interface Name

Domain Models

#### 1.5.1.2 Source Repository

REPO-DM-001

#### 1.5.1.3 Method Contracts

*No items available*

#### 1.5.1.4 Integration Pattern

Direct project reference.

#### 1.5.1.5 Communication Protocol

In-memory object reference. The AI logic reads data directly from the properties of domain model objects.

#### 1.5.1.6 Extraction Reasoning

The AI requires read-only access to the complete game state (e.g., the `GameState` aggregate root and its constituent entities like `PlayerState`) to make strategically sound decisions. It also consumes other domain models like `TradeOffer` and `AuctionState` as method parameters. This dependency is fundamental to its operation.

### 1.5.2.0 Interface Name

#### 1.5.2.1 Interface Name

IConfigurationProvider

#### 1.5.2.2 Source Repository

REPO-IC-007

#### 1.5.2.3 Method Contracts

*No items available*

#### 1.5.2.4 Integration Pattern

Indirect consumption. This repository does not depend on the configuration provider directly. Instead, the Application Services layer (REPO-AS-005) uses the configuration provider to load AI parameters and then passes the resulting configuration object to this repository's `IAIController` methods.

#### 1.5.2.5 Communication Protocol

N/A

#### 1.5.2.6 Extraction Reasoning

This defines the integration pattern for configuration, correctly placing the responsibility of loading the external AI parameters file (REQ-1-063) in the Infrastructure Layer, while this repository only consumes the strongly-typed result, thus adhering to the layered architecture.

## 1.6.0.0 Exposed Interfaces

- {'interface_name': 'IAIController', 'consumer_repositories': ['REPO-AS-005'], 'method_contracts': [{'method_name': 'GetNextAction', 'method_signature': 'PlayerAction GetNextAction(GameState state, Guid aiPlayerId, AIParameters parameters)', 'method_purpose': "To evaluate the current game state during an AI's turn and return the optimal action for the specified AI player based on its configured parameters. This is the primary method for AI turn execution.", 'implementation_requirements': "The method must be synchronous and performant to avoid delaying gameplay. It must contain robust error handling to prevent game stalls, returning a default 'EndTurn' action upon failure."}, {'method_name': 'EvaluateTrade', 'method_signature': 'TradeDecision EvaluateTrade(GameState state, Guid aiPlayerId, AIParameters parameters, TradeOffer offer)', 'method_purpose': 'To evaluate a trade proposal received from another player and return a decision to accept or decline. This method is invoked reactively by the Application Layer.', 'implementation_requirements': 'The implementation must use the provided AI parameters to make a strategic decision. Must handle errors gracefully and return a safe default (e.g., Decline) on failure.'}, {'method_name': 'GetAuctionBid', 'method_signature': 'BidDecision GetAuctionBid(GameState state, Guid aiPlayerId, AIParameters parameters, AuctionState auctionState)', 'method_purpose': "To determine the AI's next move in a property auction, deciding whether to bid or pass. This method is invoked by the Application Layer during the auction flow.", 'implementation_requirements': 'The implementation must not allow the AI to bid more cash than it possesses. Must handle errors gracefully and return a safe default (e.g., Pass) on failure.'}], 'service_level_requirements': ["High performance: Decision-making for all methods must be fast enough to be perceived as nearly instant by the user, especially when game speed is set to 'Fast' or 'Instant'."], 'implementation_constraints': ["All implementations must be pure functions; they must not modify the input 'GameState' object.", "All returned objects ('PlayerAction', 'TradeDecision', 'BidDecision') represent proposals or decisions, not executed actions."], 'extraction_reasoning': "This interface provides the necessary abstraction between the AI's complex internal logic and the Application Services Layer (REPO-AS-005), which orchestrates all game events. The exposed methods cover all required AI interaction points identified in sequence diagrams (turn execution, trade evaluation, auction bidding)."}

## 1.7.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0 Framework Requirements

.NET 8, C#

### 1.7.2.0 Integration Technologies

- Panda BT (or similar Behavior Tree Framework)

### 1.7.3.0 Performance Constraints
