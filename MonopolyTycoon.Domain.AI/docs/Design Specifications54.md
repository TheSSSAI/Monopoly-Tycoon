# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary: Encapsulate all AI opponent decision-making logic using a Behavior Tree architecture, as per REQ-1-063.
- Secondary: Isolate the third-party Behavior Tree framework dependency (e.g., Panda BT) to prevent impacts on the core domain logic.
- Tertiary: Provide the logic for all AI player actions, including property management, trading, and auction participation, as specified in REQ-1-062.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- .NET 8
- C#
- Behavior Tree Framework

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must be implemented within the Business Logic (Domain) Layer, with no dependencies on Presentation, Application, or Infrastructure layers.
- AI behavior must be tunable via parameters loaded from an external JSON file (REQ-1-063).
- The repository must not mutate the game state directly; it should return proposed actions to be validated and executed by the Application Services layer.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

- {'dependency_type': 'Compile-time Reference', 'target_component': 'MonopolyTycoon.Domain (REPO-DM-001)', 'integration_pattern': 'Direct project reference for compile-time access to domain model classes.', 'reasoning': "The AI logic requires read-only access to the 'GameState' aggregate and its constituent entities (PlayerState, BoardState, etc.) to make informed decisions. This is the core input for the AI's decision-making process."}

### 2.1.5 Analysis Insights

This repository is a specialized, high-complexity component within the domain layer. Its primary function is to act as the 'brain' for AI opponents, translating game state into strategic actions. The choice of a Behavior Tree architecture, mandated by requirements, is well-suited for managing this complexity, promoting modularity, maintainability, and extensibility through external configuration.

# 3.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-063

#### 3.1.1.2 Requirement Description

The AI's decision-making process must be implemented using a Behavior Tree architecture and its parameters stored in an external JSON file.

#### 3.1.1.3 Implementation Implications

- A central 'AIBehaviorTreeExecutor' component must be created to load, parse, and execute the behavior tree.
- Custom 'Action' and 'Condition' nodes must be implemented as C# classes to represent specific game logic (e.g., 'CheckIfMonopolyIsOwnedCondition', 'ProposeTradeAction').
- A mechanism for deserializing the external JSON parameters into a strongly-typed configuration object is required.

#### 3.1.1.4 Required Components

- AIBehaviorTreeExecutor

#### 3.1.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This is the foundational requirement dictating the entire architecture of this repository. The 'AIBehaviorTreeExecutor' is the entry point and orchestrator for all AI logic.

### 3.1.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-004

#### 3.1.2.2 Requirement Description

The system must provide at least three distinct AI difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

#### 3.1.2.3 Implementation Implications

- The external JSON file will contain different parameter sets for each difficulty level.
- Behavior tree nodes must be designed to use these injected parameters to alter their decision thresholds, weights, and logic (e.g., a 'Hard' AI will have a lower risk tolerance for trades).

#### 3.1.2.4 Required Components

- AIBehaviorTreeExecutor

#### 3.1.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement is implemented by leveraging the external parameterization specified in REQ-1-063. The core behavior tree structure can remain the same while its behavior is modified by the loaded data, fulfilling the Strategy pattern.

### 3.1.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-062

#### 3.1.3.2 Requirement Description

AI opponents must be capable of performing all actions available to a human player.

#### 3.1.3.3 Implementation Implications

- The repository must contain a comprehensive library of custom 'Action' nodes, each corresponding to a specific game action (e.g., BuildHouse, MortgageProperty, MakeTradeOffer, BidInAuction).
- The behavior tree must be structured to correctly select and parameterize these actions based on the game state and turn phase.

#### 3.1.3.4 Required Components

- AIBehaviorTreeExecutor

#### 3.1.3.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement dictates the functional scope of the AI. The behavior tree must be expressive enough to cover the entire set of legal game moves.

### 3.1.4.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.4.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-064

#### 3.1.4.2 Requirement Description

AI players must be able to evaluate trade proposals based on a configurable set of heuristics.

#### 3.1.4.3 Implementation Implications

- A dedicated, complex 'Action' or 'Service' for trade evaluation is required.
- This logic will use the injected heuristics from the external configuration file to assign a value to properties, cash, and monopolies for both the AI and its trading partner, ultimately returning an 'Accept' or 'Decline' decision.

#### 3.1.4.4 Required Components

- AIBehaviorTreeExecutor

#### 3.1.4.5 Analysis Reasoning

This is a specific, high-complexity case of REQ-1-062. It necessitates a sophisticated evaluation function within a dedicated behavior tree node, as confirmed by sequence diagrams like SEQ-198.

## 3.2.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1 Requirement Type

Extensibility

#### 3.2.1.2 Requirement Specification

AI behavior parameters stored in an external JSON file (REQ-1-063).

#### 3.2.1.3 Implementation Impact

The design must decouple the AI logic within nodes from the specific values that drive decisions. These values (e.g., bidding thresholds) must be accessed from a configuration object injected into the executor.

#### 3.2.1.4 Design Constraints

- No hard-coded 'magic numbers' for AI strategy; all tunable parameters must be externalized.
- The system must be able to load and apply new AI profiles without recompilation.

#### 3.2.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This NFR directly promotes a flexible and adaptable AI system, allowing for future balancing and the addition of new difficulty levels or AI personalities easily.

### 3.2.2.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1 Requirement Type

Maintainability

#### 3.2.2.2 Requirement Specification

Use of Behavior Tree architecture isolates and modularizes AI logic.

#### 3.2.2.3 Implementation Impact

The codebase should be structured into small, single-responsibility 'Action' and 'Condition' node classes. This fine-grained structure makes the code easier to understand, debug, and test.

#### 3.2.2.4 Design Constraints

- Each node class should be self-contained and testable in isolation.
- Complex logic should be composed of several simpler nodes rather than being implemented in one monolithic node.

#### 3.2.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

The architectural choice of Behavior Trees directly satisfies the need for a maintainable AI system by breaking down a complex problem into a hierarchical set of simple, reusable components.

## 3.3.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The requirements for this repository are highly synergistic. REQ-1-063 provides the architectural blueprint (Behavior Tree) which serves as the foundation for implementing all functional AI behaviors (REQ-1-062, REQ-1-064) and enables the configurability needed for different difficulty levels (REQ-1-004). The design must prioritize modularity and external parameterization.

# 4.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1 Pattern Name

Behavior Tree

#### 4.1.1.2 Pattern Application

The core pattern for structuring all AI decision-making logic. The tree will be composed of sequences, selectors, decorators, and custom leaf nodes (actions and conditions) to produce a desired player action for a given game state.

#### 4.1.1.3 Required Components

- AIBehaviorTreeExecutor
- ActionNode
- ConditionNode

#### 4.1.1.4 Implementation Strategy

A third-party Behavior Tree framework for .NET will be used. This repository will focus on implementing the game-specific logic within custom node classes that plug into the framework. The 'AIBehaviorTreeExecutor' will be the primary class that initializes and 'ticks' the tree each turn.

#### 4.1.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is explicitly mandated by REQ-1-063 and is well-suited for creating complex, modular, and visually debuggable AI behaviors, satisfying key maintainability and extensibility goals.

### 4.1.2.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1 Pattern Name

Strategy

#### 4.1.2.2 Pattern Application

Different AI difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) are treated as different strategies. The same behavior tree structure can be used for all difficulties, but its execution is altered by loading a different set of parameters (e.g., risk aversion, property valuation multipliers).

#### 4.1.2.3 Required Components

- AIBehaviorTreeExecutor

#### 4.1.2.4 Implementation Strategy

The 'AIBehaviorTreeExecutor' will be instantiated with a specific 'AIParameters' configuration object corresponding to the selected difficulty. Nodes within the tree will then reference this configuration to make their decisions.

#### 4.1.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is a direct implementation of REQ-1-004 and the parameterization requirement of REQ-1-063, allowing for flexible AI behavior without altering the compiled code.

The AI is not planning its own turn but responding to an external event, requiring a dedicated method for this evaluation.'}

#### 6.1.3.5 Analysis Reasoning

This sequence solidifies the requirement for complex evaluation logic within the AI, driven by configurable heuristics as per REQ-1-064.

## 6.2.0.0 Communication Protocols

- {'protocol_type': 'In-Memory Method Invocation', 'implementation_requirements': "The repository will expose a public class ('AIBehaviorTreeExecutor') implementing a domain interface ('IAIExecutor'). The Application Services layer will use .NET's dependency injection to get an instance of this service and call its methods directly.", 'analysis_reasoning': "As a component within a monolithic architecture, direct method calls are the most efficient and straightforward communication protocol. The use of 'async/await' is recommended for future-proofing and consistency, even if current logic is CPU-bound."}
