# 3 Description

This repository encapsulates all logic related to the Artificial Intelligence opponents. It was decomposed from `MonopolyTycoon.Domain` to isolate the specialized AI decision-making from the core game rules. It contains the `AIBehaviorTreeExecutor` which, as required by REQ-1-063, uses a Behavior Tree architecture to drive AI actions. The AI's behavior is influenced by parameters loaded from an external source, allowing for tunable difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) as per REQ-1-004. Separating the AI into its own repository allows AI developers to work independently, focusing on strategy and behavior tuning. It also isolates the third-party Behavior Tree library dependency (Panda BT), so updates to that library do not affect the core rule engine or other domain components.

# 24.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 24.1.0 Must Implement

- Decision-making logic for all possible AI actions (buy, build, trade, mortgage, etc.).
- A clear, demonstrable difference in strategic behavior for Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels (REQ-1-064).
- The ability to evaluate and propose trades to other players.

## 24.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Directly modifying the game state; the AI must only propose actions for the Application Layer to execute.
- Enforcing game rules; it assumes the RuleEngine will validate its proposed actions.
- Managing game flow or turns.

## 24.3.0 Extension Points

- New behavior tree nodes can be created and added to the AI's logic to introduce more complex strategies.
- The external JSON configuration file (REQ-1-063) is the primary extension point for tuning AI behavior without recompiling.
