## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Inno Setup toolchain for creating the installer package (as per SRS 2.2).
- A valid code signing certificate to digitally sign the executable.
- A stable, release-candidate build of the game application and all its assets.

- The final game build size being larger than anticipated, affecting disk space requirements.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- The CI/CD pipeline, which will trigger the Inno Setup script to build the installer after a successful game build.
- The game's executable, which must be correctly referenced and packaged by the installer.

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Manual E2E
- Compatibility Testing

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Test full installation and launch on clean installs of Windows 10 and Windows 11.
- Test installation to a non-default path (e.g., 'D:\Games').
- Test installation to a path containing spaces.
- Test the cancellation workflow at each step of the wizard.
- Test the insufficient disk space scenario.

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is a dependency for any form of external playtesting or release. The task of procuring the code signing certificate should be started immediately as it can have a long lead time.
- The framework for the installer can be built early, but finalization depends on a stable game build.

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

Critical for V1.0 release. The game cannot be shipped to users without a functional installer.
