# 2 Patterns

## 2.1 Layered Architecture

### 2.1.1 Name

Layered Architecture

### 2.1.2 Description

Organizes the application into horizontal layers, each with a specific responsibility. This creates a clear separation of concerns, where UI, application logic, business rules, and data access are isolated from each other.

### 2.1.3 Benefits

- Separation of Concerns
- Improved Maintainability and Testability
- Reduced Coupling between layers

### 2.1.4 Tradeoffs

- Can add complexity for very simple applications.
- Potential for performance overhead if layers are not designed carefully.

### 2.1.5 Applicability

#### 2.1.5.1 Scenarios

- Desktop applications with distinct UI, logic, and data components.
- Systems where core business logic needs to be independent of the presentation technology.
- Projects requiring unit and integration testing for different parts of the system.

#### 2.1.5.2 Constraints

- The application is self-contained and does not require distributed deployment.

## 2.2.0.0 Model-View-Controller (MVC) / Model-View-Presenter (MVP)

### 2.2.1.0 Name

Model-View-Controller (MVC) / Model-View-Presenter (MVP)

### 2.2.2.0 Description

A pattern used to separate the application's data model and business rules (Model) from the user interface (View) and user input handling (Controller/Presenter). In Unity, C# scripts (MonoBehaviours) often act as Controllers/Presenters, manipulating GameObjects (Views) based on the state of plain C# objects (Models).

### 2.2.3.0 Benefits

- Decouples UI from game logic, allowing each to be modified independently.
- Facilitates easier UI development and testing.
- Improves code organization within the presentation layer.

### 2.2.4.0 Applicability

#### 2.2.4.1 Scenarios

- Applications with a graphical user interface, such as games.
- Systems where the same underlying data needs to be presented in multiple ways.

## 2.3.0.0 Repository Pattern

### 2.3.1.0 Name

Repository Pattern

### 2.3.2.0 Description

Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects. It abstracts the data source, so the application logic doesn't need to know if data is coming from a file, a database, or another source.

### 2.3.3.0 Benefits

- Decouples business logic from data access implementation.
- Centralizes data access logic, making it easier to manage.
- Enhances testability by allowing mock repositories to be used in unit tests.

### 2.3.4.0 Applicability

#### 2.3.4.1 Scenarios

- Applications that need to persist data to different storage mechanisms (e.g., JSON files for game saves, SQLite for statistics).
- Systems where data access logic is complex and needs to be tested independently.

## 2.4.0.0 Behavior Tree

### 2.4.1.0 Name

Behavior Tree

### 2.4.2.0 Description

A mathematical model of plan execution used in AI applications. It allows for the creation of complex behaviors from simple, reusable tasks, organized in a tree-like structure. This is explicitly required by REQ-1-063 for AI implementation.

### 2.4.3.0 Benefits

- Modular and reusable AI logic.
- Easy to understand and debug AI behavior visually.
- Scalable for creating complex and varied AI opponents.

### 2.4.4.0 Applicability

#### 2.4.4.1 Scenarios

- Implementing AI for game characters with complex decision-making processes.
- Defining AI strategies that can be tuned via external parameters for different difficulty levels.
