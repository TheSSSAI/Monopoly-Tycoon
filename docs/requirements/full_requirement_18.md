    "section_requirement_text": "## Monopoly Tycoon - Software Requirements Specification\n\n### 1. Game Core Functionality\n*   The game shall implement the standard rules and gameplay mechanics of the Monopoly board game.\n*   All gameplay elements, including but not limited to, property acquisition, rent collection, building houses/hotels, mortgaging, trading, and bankruptcy, shall adhere to the latest known official Monopoly rule set.\n\n### 2. Game Board and Spaces\n*   The game board shall accurately represent the standard 40 spaces, including:\n    *   28 Properties: 22 colored properties (grouped into 8 color sets), 4 Railroads, and 2 Utilities.\n    *   3 Chance spaces.\n    *   3 Community Chest spaces.\n    *   2 Tax spaces (Income Tax, Luxury Tax).\n    *   Special corner spaces: Go, Jail/Just Visiting, Free Parking, Go to Jail.\n\n### 3. Player Management\n*   The game shall support 2 to 4 players, all of whom will be computer-controlled (AI).\n*   Each player shall have a distinct visual game piece.\n\n### 4. Dice Mechanics\n*   The game shall simulate the rolling of two six-sided dice to determine player movement.\n*   The rule for rolling doubles (allowing an extra turn) and the consequence of rolling three consecutive doubles (going to Jail) shall be implemented.\n\n### 5. Property Management\n*   **Ownership:** Players can purchase unowned properties they land on. If a player declines to purchase, the property shall immediately go to auction, with all players (including the one who declined) able to bid.\n*   **Rent:** Rent shall be automatically collected from a player landing on an owned property. Rent amounts shall vary based on the property, the number of houses/hotels built, and for Railroads/Utilities, the number of properties owned in their respective sets.\n*   **Monopoly:** Owning all properties within a color set (a 'Monopoly') shall enable the owner to build houses and hotels on those properties.\n*   **Houses & Hotels:** Players can build houses and hotels on properties within a complete color set. Building must adhere to the 'even building' rule (properties in a set must be built up evenly). There shall be a limited supply of houses and hotels, managed by the Bank.\n*   **Mortgage:** Properties can be mortgaged to the Bank for cash. Mortgaged properties do not collect rent. Properties can be unmortgaged by paying the mortgage value plus a 10% interest fee.\n*   **Trading:** The game shall allow computer players to engage in trades, exchanging properties, cash, and 'Get Out of Jail Free' cards with each other.\n\n### 6. Special Space Rules\n*   **Go:** Players passing or landing on 'Go' shall collect $200 from the Bank.\n*   **Jail:**\n    *   Players go to Jail by landing on 'Go to Jail', drawing a 'Go to Jail' card, or rolling three consecutive doubles.\n    *   Players can get out of Jail by paying a $50 fine, using a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card, or rolling doubles on one of their next three turns.\n*   **Free Parking:** Landing on Free Parking shall have no effect, adhering to standard Monopoly rules.\n*   **Chance & Community Chest:** When a player lands on these spaces, a card shall be drawn, and its instructions (e.g., collect money, pay money, move to a specific space, go to Jail, receive a 'Get Out of Jail Free' card) shall be executed.\n*   **Tax Spaces:** Players landing on Income Tax or Luxury Tax shall pay the specified amount to the Bank.\n\n### 7. Game Economy\n*   Each player shall start with the standard amount of cash.\n*   The Bank shall manage all monetary transactions, including initial funds, property purchases, rent payments, taxes, building costs, and mortgage transactions.\n\n### 8. Game End & Bankruptcy\n*   The game shall conclude when only one player remains, all other players having gone bankrupt.\n*   Bankruptcy occurs when a player cannot meet their financial obligations (e.g., rent, taxes) even after selling all houses/hotels and mortgaging all properties. Assets shall be transferred to the creditor (Bank or another player).\n\n### 9. Difficulty Level Setting\n*   The game shall include a difficulty level setting, allowing players to choose the challenge level of the computer opponents.\n\n### 10. Computer AI\n*   The game shall feature a sophisticated computer algorithmic AI for all opposing players.\n*   The AI's behavior (e.g., buying strategy, trading aggressiveness, building strategy, mortgage decisions) shall be tunable based on the selected difficulty level.\n*   The AI shall be designed to provide a challenging and realistic opponent experience across different difficulty settings.\n\n### 11. Top Score History\n*   The game shall maintain a persistent top score history, recording the highest scores or most successful game outcomes.\n\n### 12. Save Game Feature\n*   Players shall be able to save their game progress at any point and load a previously saved game.\n\n### 13. Audio\n*   The game shall incorporate sound effects for key actions (e.g., dice rolls, property purchases, money transactions) and background music.\n\n### 14. Graphics & Visuals\n*   The game shall feature <<$Change>>high-quality 3D graphics with modern visual fidelity and artistic polish, aiming for an immersive and visually appealing experience.<<$Change>>\n*   The game shall utilize an isometric view for gameplay.\n*   Interactive graphical elements shall be implemented to enhance user experience (e.g., animated dice, moving player tokens, property highlights).\n\n#### Enhancement Justification:\n*   **Requirement:** \"The graphics must be like AAA games graphics.\"\n*   **Reason for Change:** The original requirement for \"AAA games graphics\" is practically unachievable for a project of this scope due to the immense resources (budget, team size, time) typically required. This change redefines the graphical target to a high-quality, modern standard that is realistic for a dedicated development effort using contemporary game engines or rendering APIs, without setting an unquantifiable and unattainable bar. It focuses on achieving a visually appealing and immersive experience rather than an industry-leading, resource-intensive benchmark.\n\n### 15. Theme System\n*   The game shall include a theme system that allows for dynamic changes to visual assets (e.g., board appearance, property designs, player tokens) and sound packages.\n*   This system shall enable the creation and application of different aesthetic styles and audio experiences.\n\n### 16. No Online Features\n*   The game shall be strictly an offline, single-player experience against computer opponents. No online multiplayer or internet connectivity features are required.\n\n### 17. Platform and Technology\n*   The game shall be developed using the .NET framework.\n*   The game shall be easily installed and playable on Windows OS.\n*   For rendering, modern technologies such as Unity (using C# scripting), Godot (using C#), or a low-level API wrapper like SharpDX/Vulkan.NET shall be considered to achieve the desired graphical quality and performance on Windows.\n\n### 18. Removed Requirements\n*   <<$Change>>The requirement to \"Add some exciting features like never before\" has been removed.<<$Change>>\n\n#### Enhancement Justification:\n*   **Requirement:** \"Add some exciting features like never before.\"\n*   **Reason for Change:** This requirement is extremely vague, subjective, and provides no actionable criteria for development or testing. Furthermore, it directly conflicts with the explicit requirement to \"keep all the gameplay elements as the standard Monopoly game.\" Introducing \"exciting features like never before\" would fundamentally alter the standard Monopoly experience, which is contrary to the core game definition. Removing this non-specific and contradictory statement ensures the project focuses on delivering a faithful and high-quality implementation of the standard Monopoly game.\n",

These levels will govern the AI's strategic decision-making.\n\n### 3.2 Tunable AI Behavior Parameters\nThe AI's behavior shall be controlled by a set of parameters that are tuned for each difficulty level. These parameters include, but are not limited to:\n*   **Property Purchase Threshold:** The logic determining whether to buy an unowned property based on its value, color group potential, and the AI's current cash reserves.\n*   **Building Strategy:** The priority given to building on completed monopolies.\n*   **Trading Aggressiveness:** The frequency of initiating trades and the perceived value required to accept a trade.\n*   **Mortgage Management:** The strategy for mortgaging properties to raise cash and for paying off mortgages.\n\n### 3.3 Difficulty Level Characteristics\n*   **Easy:** AI will play sub-optimally. It may decline to buy valuable properties, fail to complete monopolies, and accept poor trades.\n*   **Medium:** AI will play competently. It will prioritize completing monopolies, build houses when able, and only engage in relatively fair trades.\n*   **Hard:** AI will play strategically. It will aggressively pursue monopolies, use trades to block opponents, manage its cash flow efficiently, and prioritize building to maximize rent income.",
