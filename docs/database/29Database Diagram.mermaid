This diagram illustrates the database schema for a game, focusing on player profiles, their statistics, saved games, and the results of completed game sessions. The PlayerProfile entity is central, linked one-to-one with PlayerStatistic and one-to-many with GameResult and SavedGame. Each GameResult is composed of one or more GameParticipants, detailing the performance of each player (human or AI) in that specific game.
