This ER diagram illustrates the database schema for the Monopoly Tycoon Player Data Store. It shows how player profiles are linked to their aggregated statistics in a one-to-one relationship. It also details the one-to-many relationships between a player and their game results, saved games, and the composition of each game result with its participants. The schema is designed to track player progression, game history, and saved states.
